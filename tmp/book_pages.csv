Page 10,"Introduction: Too Much Wisdom W hat s h o u lIdd , how should I live, and whom should I become? Many of us ask such questions, and, modern life being what it is, we don't have to go far to find answers. Wisdom is now so cheap and abundant that it floods over us from calendar pages, tea bags, bottle caps, and mass e-mail mes­ sages forwarded by well-meaning friends. We are in a way like residents of Jorge Luis Borgess Library of Babel—an infinite library whose books con­ tain every possible string of letters and, therefore, somewhere an explana­ tion of why the library exists and how to use it. But Borges’s librarians suspect that they will never find that book amid the miles of nonsense. Our prospects are better. Few of our potential sources of wisdom are nonsense, and many are entirely true. Yet, because our library is also effec­ tively infinite—no one person can ever read more than a tiny fraction—we face the paradox of abundance: Quantity undermines the quality of our en­ gagement. With such a vast and wonderful library spread out before us, we often skim books or read just the reviews. We might already have encoun­ tered the Greatest Idea, the insight that would have transformed us had we savored it, taken it to heart, and worked it into our lives. This is a book about ten Great Ideas. Each chapter is an attempt to savor one idea that has been discovered by several of the worldscivilizations— to question it in light ofwhat'we now know from scientific research, and to ex­ tract from it the lessons that still apply to our modem lives.",353
Page 11,"x Introduction:TooMuch Wisdom I am a social psychologist. I do experiments to try to figure out one cor­ ner of human social life, and my corner is morality and the moral emotions. I am also a teacher. I teach a large introductory psychology class at the University ofVirginia in which I try to explain the entire field of psychology in twenty-four lectures. I have to present a thousand research findings on everything from the structure of the retina to the workings of love, and then hope that my students will understand and remember it all. As I struggled with this challenge in my first year of teaching, I realized that several ideas kept recurring across lectures, and that often these ideas had been stated eloquently by past thinkers. To summarize the idea that our emotions, our reactions to events, and some mental illnesses are caused by the mental filters through which we look at the world, I could not sayit any more concisely than Shakespeare: “There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.”1I began to use such quotations to help my students remember the big ideas in psychology, and I began to wonder just how many such ideas there were. To find out, I read dozens of works of ancient wisdom, mostly from the worlds three great zones of classical thought: India (for example, the Upan- ishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the sayings of the Buddha), China (the Analects of Confucius, the Tao te Ching, the writings of Meng Tzu and other philos­ ophers), and the cultures of the Mediterranean (the Old and New Testa­ ments, the Greek and Roman philosophers, the Koran). I also read avariety of other works of philosophy and literature from the last five hundred years. Every time I found a psychological claim— a statement about human nature or the workings of the mind or heart— I wrote it down. Whenever I found an idea expressed in several places and times I considered it a possible Great Idea. But rather than mechanically listing the top ten all-time most widespread psychological ideas of humankind, I decided that coherence was more important than frequency. I wanted to write about a set of ideas that would fit together, build upon each other, and tell a story about how human beings can find happiness and meaning in life. Helping people find happiness and meaning is precisely the goal of the new field of positive psychology,2 a field in which I have been active,3 so this book is in a way about the origins of positive psychology in ancient wis­ dom and the applications of positive psychology today. Most of the research",538
Page 12,"Introduction: Too Much Wisdom xi I will cover was done by scientists who would not consider themselves posi­ tive psychologists. Nonetheless, I have drawn on ten ancient ideas and a great variety of modern research findings to tell the best story I can about the causes of human flourishing, and the obstacles to well being that we place in our own paths. The story begins with an account of how the human mind works. Not a full account, of course, just two ancient truths that must be understood be­ fore you can take advantage of modem psychology to improve your life. The first truth is the foundational idea of this book: The mind is divided into parts that sometimes conflict. Like a rider on the back of an elephant, the con­ scious, reasoning part of the mind has only limited control of what the ele­ phant does. Nowadays, we know the causes of these divisions, and a few ways to help the rider and the elephant work better as a team. The second idea is Shakespeare's, about how “thinking makes it so.”(Or, as Buddha4said, “Our life is the creation of our mind.”) But we can improve this ancient idea today by explaining why most people s minds have a bias toward seeing threats and engaging in useless worry. We can also do something to change this bias by using three techniques that increase happiness, one ancient and two verynew. The second step in the story is to give an account of our social lives— again, not a complete account, just two truths, widely known but not suf­ ficiently appreciated. One is the Golden Rule. Reciprocity is the most important tool for getting along with people, and 111show you how'you can use it to solve problems in your own life and avoid being exploited by those who use reciprocityagainst you. However, reciprocityis more thanjust a tool. It is also a clue about who we humans are and what we need, a clue that will be important for understanding the end of the larger story. The second truth in this part of the story is that we are all, by nature, hypocrites, and this is why it is so hard for us to follow the Golden Rule faithfully. Recent psycho­ logical research has uncovered the mental mechanisms that make us so good at seeing the slightest speck in our neighbors eye, and so bad at seeing the log in our own. If you know what your mind is up to, and why you so easily see the world through a distorting lens of good and evil, you can take steps to reduce your self-righteousness. You can thereby^educe the frequencyof con­ flicts with others who are equally convinced jrftheir righteousness.",553
Page 13,"xii Introduction: Too Much Wisdom At this point in the story, well be ready to ask: Where does happiness come from? There are several different “happiness hypotheses.” One is that happiness comes from getting what you want, but we all know (and re­ search confirms) that such happiness is short-lived. A more promising hy­ pothesis is that happiness comes from within and cannot be obtained by making the world conform to your desires. This idea was widespread in the ancient world: Buddha in India and the Stoic philosophers in ancient Greece and Rome all counseled people to break their emotional attach­ ments to people and events, which are always unpredictable and uncon­ trollable, and to cultivate instead an attitude of acceptance. This ancient idea deserves respect, and it is certainly true that changing your mind is usually a more effective response to frustration than is changing the world. However, I will present evidence that this second version of the happiness hypothesis is wrong. Recent research shows that there are some things worth striving for; there are external conditions of life that can make you lastingly happier. One of these conditions is relatedness— the bonds we form, and need to form, with others. IT1 present research showing where love comes from, why passionate love always cools, and what kind of love is “true” love. IT1 suggest that the happiness hypothesis offered by Buddha and the Stoics should be amended: Happiness comes from within, and happiness comes from without. We need the guidance of both ancient wis­ dom and modern science to get the balance right. The next step in this story about flourishing is to look at the conditions of human growth and development. WeVe all heard that what doesn't kill us makes us stronger, but that is a dangerous oversimplification. Many of the things that dont kill you can damage you for life. Recent research on “posttraumatic growth” reveals when and why people grow from adversity, and what you can do to prepare yourself for trauma, or to cope with it after the fact. We have also all heard repeated urgings to cultivate virtue in our­ selves, because virtue is its own reward, but that, too, is an oversimplifi­ cation. I'll show how concepts of virtue and morality have changed and narrowed over the centuries, and how ancient ideas about virtue and moral development may hold promise for our own age. I'll also show how positive psychology is beginning to deliver on that promise by offering you a way to “diagnose”and develop your own strengths and virtues.",521
Page 14,"Introduction: Too Much Wisdom xiii The conclusion of the story is the question of meaning: Why do some people find meaning, purpose, and fulfillment in life, but others do not? I begin with the culturally widespread idea that there is a vertical, spiritual dimension of human existence. Whether it is called nobility, virtue, or di­ vinity, and whether or not God exists, people simply do perceive sacred­ ness, holiness, or some ineffable goodness in others, and in nature. IT1 present my own research on the moral emotions of disgust, elevation, and awe to explain how this vertical dimension works, and why the dimension is so important for understanding religious fundamentalism, the political culture war, and the human quest for meaning. Til also consider what people mean when they ask, “What is the meaning of life?”And IT1give an answer to the question—an answer that draws on ancient ideas about hav­ ing a purpose but that uses veryrecent research to go beyond these ancient ideas, or any ideas you are likely to have encountered. In doing so, IT1 re­ vise the happiness hypothesis one last time. I could state that final version here in a few words, but I could not explain it in this brief introduction without cheapening it. Words ofwisdom, the meaning of life, perhaps even the answer sought by Borgess librarians—all of these may wash over us every day, but they can do little for us unless we savor them, engage with them, question them, improve them, and connect them to our lives. That is my goal in this book.",330

I wasn’t alone— there were eight other people on eight other horses, and one of the people was a park ranger—so the ride didn’t ask much of me. There was, however, one difficult moment. We were riding along a path on a steep hillside, two by two, and my horse was on the outside, walking about three feet from the edge. Then the path turned sharply to the left, and my horse was heading straight for the edge. I froze. I knew I had to steer left, but there was another horse to my left and I didn’t want to crash into it. I might have called out for help, or screamed, “Look out!”; but some part of me preferred the risk of going over the edge to the certainty of looking stupid. So I just froze. I did nothing at all during the critical*five J",334

The horse knew exactly what she was doing. She’d walked this path a hundred times, and she had no more interest in tumbling to her death than I had. She didn’t need me to tell her what to do, and, in fact, the few times I tried to tell her what to do she didn’t much seem to care. I had gotten it all so wrong be­ cause I had spent the previous ten years driving cars, not horses. Cars go over edges unless you tell them not tp. Human thinking depends on metaphor. We understand new or complex things in relation to things we already know.3For example, its hard to think about life in general, but once you apply the metaphor “life is a journey,” the metaphor guides you to some conclusions: You should learn the terrain, pick a direction, find some good traveling companions, and enjoy the trip, because there may be nothing at the end of the road. Its also hard to think about the mind, but once you pick a metaphor it will guide your thinking. Throughout recorded history, people have lived with and tried to control animals, and these animals made their way into ancient metaphors. Bud­ dha, for example, compared the mind to a wild elephant: In days gone by this mind of mine used to stray wherever selfish desire or lust or pleasure would lead it. Today this mind does not stray and is under the harmony of control, even as a wild elephant is controlled by the trainer.4 Plato used a similar metaphor in which the self (or soul) is a chariot, and the calm, rational part of the mind holds the reins. Plato’scharioteer had to control two horses: The horse that is on the right, or nobler, side is upright in frame and well jointed, with a high neck and a regal nose; ... he is a lover of honor with modesty and self-control; companion to true glory, he needs no whip, and is guided by verbal commands alone. The other horse is a crooked greatjumble of limbs . . . companion to wild boasts and indecency, he is",489
Page 18,"The Divided Self 3 shaggy around the ears—deaf as a post—and just barelyyields to horse­ whip and goad combined.5 For Plato, some of the emotions and passions are good (for example, the love of honor), and they help pull the self in the right direction, but others are bad (for example, the appetites and lusts). The goal of Platonic educa­ tion was to help the charioteer gain perfect control over the two horses. Sig­ mund Freud offered us a related model 2,300 years later.6Freud said that the mind is divided into three parts: the ego (the conscious, rational self); the superego (the conscience, a sometimes too rigid commitment to the rules of society); and the id (the desire for pleasure, lots of it, sooner rather than later). The metaphor I use when I lecture on Freud is to think of the mind as a horse and buggy (a Victorian chariot) in which the driver (the ego) struggles frantically to control a hungry, lustful, and disobedient horse (the id) while the drivers father (the superego) sits in the back seat lectur­ ing the driver on what he is doing wrong. For Freud, the goal of psycho­ analysis was to escape this pitiful state by strengthening the ego, thus giving it more control over the id and more independence from the superego. Freud, Plato, and Buddha all lived in worlds full of domesticated animals. They were familiar with the struggle to assert ones will over a creature much larger than the self. But as the twentieth century wore on, cars replaced horses, and technology gave people ever more control over their physical worlds. When people looked for metaphors, they saw the mind as the driver of a car, or as a program running on a computer. It became possible to forget all about Freuds unconscious, andjust study the mechanisms ofthinking and decision making. Thats what social scientists did in the last third of the cen­ tury: Social psychologists created “information processing"" theories to explain everything from prejudice to friendship. Economists created “rational choice"" models to explain whypeople do what they do. The social sciences were unit­ ing under the idea that people are rational agents who set goals and pursue them intelligentlyby using the information and resources at their disposal. But then, why do people keep doing such stupid things? Why do they lail to control themselves and continue to do what they know is not good (or them? I, for one, can easily muster the willpower to ignore all the",544

I can resolve to focus on a task and not get up until it is done, yet somehow I find myself walking into the kitchen, or procrastinating in other ways. I can resolve to wake up at 6:00 A.M. to write; yet after I have shut off the alarm, my repeated commands to myself to get out of bed have no effect, and I understand what Plato meant when he described the bad horse as “deaf as a post.” But it was during some larger life decisions, about dating; that I really began to grasp the extent of my powerlessness. I would know exactly what I should do, yet, even as I was telling my friends that I would do it, a part of me was dimly aware that I was not going to. Feelings of guilt, lust, or fear were often stronger than reasoning. (On the other hand, I was quite good at lecturing friends in similar situations about what was right for them.) The Roman poet Ovid captured my situation perfectly. In Metamorphoses, Medea is torn between her love for Jason and her duty to her father. She laments: I am dragged along by a strange new force. Desire and reason are pulling in different directions. I s&ethe right way and approve it, but follow the wrong.7 Modern theories about rational choice and information processing don't adequately explain weakness of the will. The older metaphors about con­ trolling animals work beautifully. The image that I came up with for my­ self, as I marveled at my weakness, was that I was a rider on the back of an elephant. Im holding the reins in my hands, and by pulling one way or the other I can tell the elephant to turn, to stop, or to go. I can direct things, but only when the elephant doesn't have desires of his own. When the ele­ phant really wants to do something, I'm no match for him. I have used this metaphor to guide my own thinking for ten years, and when I began to write this book I thought the image of a rider on an ele­ phant would be useful in this first chapter, on the divided self. However, the metaphor has turned out to be useful in every chapter of the book. To understand most important ideas in psychology, you need to understand how the mind is divided into parts that sometimes conflict. We assume",531
Page 20,"The Divided Self 5 that there is one person in each body, but in some ways we are each more like a committee whose members have been thrown together to do a job, but who often find themselves working at cross purposes. Our minds are divided in four ways. The fourth is the most important, for it corresponds most closely to the rider and the elephant; but the first three also con­ tribute to our experiences of temptation, weakness, and internal conflict. F i r s tD i v i s i : M i n d v s* B o d y We sometimes say that the body has a mind of its own, but the French philosopher Michel de Montaigne went a step further and suggested that each part of the body has its own emotions and its own agenda. Montaigne was most fascinated by the independence of the penis: We are right to note the license and disobedience of this member which thrusts itself forward so inopportunely when we do not want it to, and which so inopportunely lets us down when we most need it. It imperi­ ously contests for authority with our will.8 Montaigne also noted the ways in which our facial expressions betray our secret thoughts; our hair stands on end; our hearts race; our tongues fail to speak; and our bowels and anal sphincters undergo “dilations and contractions proper to [themselves], independent of our wishes or even op­ posed to them.”Some of these effects, we now know, are caused by the au­ tonomic nervous system— the network of nerves that controls the organs and glands of our bodies, a network that is completely independent of vol­ untary or intentional control. But the last item on Montaigne's list— the bowels—reflects the operation of a second brain. Our intestines are lined by a vast network of more than 100 million neurons; these handle all the computations needed to run the chemical refinery that processes and ex­ tracts nutrients from food.9This gut brain is like a regional administrative center that handles stuff the head brain does not need to bother with. You might expect, then, that this gut brain takes its orders from the head brain",459
Page 21,"6 Th e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s and does as it is told. But the gut brain possesses a high degree of auton­ omy, and it continues to function well even if the vagus nerve, which con­ nects the two brains together, is severed. The gut brain makes its independence known in many ways: It causes ir­ ritable bowel syndrome when it “decides”to flush out the intestines. It trig­ gers anxiety in the head brain when it detects infections in the gut, leading you to act in more cautious ways that are appropriate when you are sick.10 And it reacts in unexpected ways to anything that affects its main neuro­ transmitters, such as acetylcholine and serotonin. Hence, many of the ini­ tial side effects of Prozac and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors involve nausea and changes in bowel function. Trying to improve the work­ ings of the head brain can directly interfere with those of the gut brain. The independence of the gut brain, combined with the autonomic nature of changes to the genitals, probably contributed to ancient Indian theories in which the abdomen contains the three lower chakras—energy centers cor­ responding to the colon/anus, sexual organs, and gut. The gut chakra is even said to be the source of gut feelings and intuitions, that is, ideas that appear to come from somewhere outside ones own mind. When St. Paul lamented the battle of flesh versus Spirit, he was surely referring to some of the same divisions and frustrations that Montaigne experienced. S e c o n d D i v i s i o: L e f t v s. R i g h t A second division was discovered by accident in the 1960s when a surgeon began cutting peoples brains in half. The surgeon, Joe Bogen, had a good reason for doing this: He was trying to help people whose lives were de­ stroyed by frequent and massiye epileptic seizures. The human brain has two separate hemispheres joined by a large bundle of nerves, the corpus callosum. Seizures always begin at one spot in the brain and spread to the surrounding brain tissue. If a seizure crosses over the corpus callosum, it can spread to the entire brain, causing the person to lose consciousness, fall down, and writhe uncontrollably. Just as a military leader might blow up a bridge to prevent an enemy from crossing it, Bogen wanted to sever the corpus callosum to prevent the seizures from spreading.",538
Page 22,"The Divided Self 7 At first glance this was an insane tactic. The corpus callosum is the largest single bundle of nerves in the entire body, so it must be doing some­ thing important. Indeed it is: It allows the two halves of the brain to com­ municate and coordinate their activity. Yet research on animals found that, within a few weeks of surgery, the animals were pretty much back to nor­ mal. So Bogen took a chance with human patients, and it worked. The in­ tensity of the seizures was greatly reduced. But was there really no loss of ability? To find out, the surgical team brought in ayoung psychologist, Michael Gazzaniga, whosejob was to look for the after-effects of this “split-brain” surgery. Gazzaniga took advantage of the fact that the brain divides its processing of the world into its two hemispheres— left and right. The left hemisphere takes in information from the right half of the world (that is, it receives nerve transmissions from the right arm and leg, the right ear, and the left half of each retina, which receives light from the right half of the visual field) and sends out commands to move the limbs on the right side of the body. The right hemi­ sphere is in this respect the lefts mirror image, taking in information from the left half of the world and controlling movement on the left side of the body. Nobody knows why the signals cross over in this way in all verte­ brates; they just do. But in other respects, the two hemispheres are spe­ cialized for different tasks. The left hemisphere is specialized for language processing and analytical tasks. In visual tasks, it is better at noticing de­ tails. The right hemisphere is better at processing patterns in space, in­ cluding that all-important pattern, the face. (This is the origin of popular and oversimplified ideas about artists being “‘right-brained"" and scientists being “left-brained""). Gazzaniga used the brains division of labor to present information to each half of the brain separately. He asked patients to stare at a spot on a screen, and then flashed a word or a picture of an objectjust to the right of the spot, orjust to the left, so quickly that there was not enough time for the patient to move her gaze. If a picture of a hat was flashed just to the right of the spot, the image would register on the left half of each retina (after the image had passed through the cornea and been inverted), which then sent its neural information back to the visual processing areas in the left hemisphere. Gazzaniga would then ask, “What did you see?"" Because",563
Page 23,"8 Th e Ha p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s the left hemisphere has full language capabilities, the patient would quickly and easily say, “A hat.” If the image of the hat was flashed to the left of the spot, however, the image was sent back only to the right hemi­ sphere, which does not control speech. When Gazzaniga asked, “What did you see?”, the patient, responding from the left hemisphere, said, “Noth­ ing.”But when Gazzaniga asked the patient to use her left hand to point to the correct image on a card showing several images, she would point to the hat. Although the right hemisphere had indeed seen the hat, it did not re­ port verbally on what it had seen because it did not have access to the lan­ guage centers in the left hemisphere. It was as if a separate intelligence was trapped in the right hemisphere, its only output device the left hand.1 When Gazzaniga flashed different pictures to the two hemispheres, things grew weirder. On one occasion he flashed a picture of a chicken claw on the right, and a picture of a house and a car covered in snow on the left. The patient was then shown an array of pictures and asked to point to the one that “goes with” what he had seen. The patients right hand pointed to a picture of a chicken (which went with the chicken claw the left hemisphere had seen), but the left hand pointed to a picture of a shovel (which went with the snow scene presented to the right hemi­ sphere). When the patient was asked to explain his two responses, he did not say, “I have no idea why my left hand is pointing to a shovel; it must be something you showed my right brain.” Instead, the left hemisphere in­ stantly made up a plausible story. The patient said, without any hesitation, “Oh, thats easy The chicken claw goes with the chicken, and you need a shovel to clean out the chicken shed.”12 This finding, that people will readily fabricate reasons to explain their own behavior, is called “confabulation.” Confabulation is so frequent in workwith split-brain patients and other people suffering brain damage that Gazzaniga refers to the language centers on the left side of the brain as the interpreter module, whose job is to give a running commentary on what­ ever the self is doing, even though the interpreter module has no access to the real causes or motives of the self's behavior. For example, if the word “walk” is flashed to the right hemisphere, the patient might stand up and walk away. When asked why he is getting up, he might say, “Fm going to",570
Page 24,"The Divided Self 9 get a Coke.”The interpreter module is good at making up explanations, but not at knowing that it has done so. Science has made even stranger discoveries. In some split-brain patients, or in others who have suffered damage to the corpus callosum, the right hemisphere seems to be actively fighting with the left hemisphere in a con­ dition known as alien hand syndrome. In these cases, one hand, usually the left, acts of its own accord and seems to have its own agenda. The alien hand may pick up a ringing phone, but then refuse to pass the phone to the other hand or bring it up to an ear. The hand rejects choices the person has just made, for example, by putting back on the rack a shirt that the other hand has just picked out. It grabs the wrist of the other hand and tries to stop it from executing the persons conscious plans. Sometimes, the alien hand actually reaches for the persons own neck and tries to strangle him.13 These dramatic splits of the mind are caused by rare splits of the brain. Normal people are not split-brained. Yet the split-brain studies were impor­ tant in psychologybecause they showed in such an eerie way that the mind is a confederation of modules capable of working independently and even, sometimes, at cross-purposes. Split-brain studies are important for this book because they show in such a dramatic way that one of these modules is good at inventing convincing explanations for your behavior, even when it has no knowledge of the causes ofyour.behavior. Gazzaniga’s“interpreter module”is, essentially, the rider. You'll catch the rider confabulating in sev­ eral later chapters. T h i r d D i v i s i o: N e w v s . O l d If you live in a relatively new suburban house, your home was probably built in less than a year, and its rooms were laid out by an architect who tried to make them fulfill peoples needs. The houses on my street, how­ ever, were all built around 1900, and since then they have expanded out into their backyards. Porches were extended, then enclosed, then turned into kitchens. Extra bedrooms were built above these extensions, then bathrooms were tacked on to these new rooms. The brain in vertebrates",485
Page 25,"10 T h e Ha p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s has similarly expanded, but in a forward direction. The brain started off withjust three rooms, or clumps of neurons: a hindbrain (connected to the spinal column), a midbrain, and a forebrain (connected to the sensory or­ gans at the front of the animal). Over time, as more complex bodies and behaviors evolved, the brain kept building out the front, away from the spinal column, expanding the forebrain more than any other part. The fore­ brain of the earliest mammals developed a new outer shell, which included the hypothalamus (specialized to coordinate basic drives and motivations), the hippocampus (specialized for memory), and the amygdala (specialized for emotional learning and responding). These structures are sometimes referred to as the limbic system (from Latin limbus, “border” or “margin”) because they wrap around the rest of the brain, forming a border. As mammals grew in size and diversified in behavior (after the.dinosaurs became extinct), the remodeling continued. In the more social mammals, particularly among primates, a new layer of neural tissue developed and spread to surround the old limbic system. This neocortex (Latin for “new covering”) is the gray matter characteristic of human brains. The front por­ tion of the neocortex is particularly interesting, for parts of it do not appear to be dedicated to specific tasks (such as moving a finger or processing sound). Instead, it is available to make new associations and to engage in thinking, planning, and decision making—mental processes that can free an organism from responding only to an immediate situation. This growth of the frontal cortex seems like a promising explanation for the divisions we experience in our minds. Perhaps the frontal cortex is the seat of reason: It is Platos charioteer; it is St. Pauls Spirit. And it has taken over control, though not perfectly, from the more primitive limbic system— Plato's bad horse, St. Paul's flesh. We can call this explanation the Pro­ methean script of human evolution, after the character in Greek mythology who stole fire from the gods and gave it to humans. In this script, our ances­ tors were mere animals governed by the primitive emotions and drives of the limbic system until they received the divine gift of reason, installed in the newly expanded neocortex. The Promethean script is pleasing in that it neatly raises us above all other animals, justifying our superiority by our rationality. At the same time, it captures our sense that we are not yet gods—that the fire of ratio-",553
Page 26,"The Divided Self 11 iiality is somehow new to us, and we have not yet fully mastered it. The Promethean script also fits well with some important early findings about Ihe roles of the limbic system and the frontal cortex. For example, when some regions of the hypothalamus are stimulated directly with a small electric current, rats, cats, and other mammals can be made gluttonous, fe­ rocious, or hypersexual, suggesting that the limbic system underlies many of our basic animal instincts.14Conversely, when people suffer damage to the frontal cortex, they sometimes show an increase in sexual and aggres­ sive behavior because the frontal cortex plays an important role in sup­ pressing or inhibiting behavioral impulses. There was recently such a case at the University of Virginias hospital.15 A schoolteacher in his forties had, fairly suddenly, begun to visit prosti­ tutes, surf child pornography Web sites, and proposition young girls. He was soon arrested and convicted of child molestation. The day before his sentencing, he went to the hospital emergency room because he had a pounding headache and was experiencing a constant urge to rape his land­ lady. (His wife had thrown him out of the house months earlier.) Even while he was talking to the doctor, he asked passing nurses to sleep with him. A brain scan found that an enormous tumor in his frontal cortex was squeezing everything else, preventing the frontal cortex from doing its job of inhibiting inappropriate behavior and thinking about consequences. (Who in his right mind would put on such a show the day before his sen- lencing?) When the tumor was removed, the hypersexuality vanished. Moreover, when the tumor grew back the following year, the symptoms re­ lumed; and when the tumor was removed again, the symptoms disap­ peared again. There is, however, a flaw in the Promethean script: It assumes that rea­ son was installed in the frontal cortex but that emotion stayed behind in the limbic system. In fact, the frontal cortex enabled a great expansion of emotionality in humans. The lower third of the prefrontal cortex is called (he orbitofrontal cortex because it is the part of the brain just above the eyes (orbit is the Latin term for the eye socket). This region of the cortex has grown especially large in humans and other primates and is one of the most consistently active areas of the brain during emotional reactions.16 The orbitofrontal cortex plays a central role when you size up the reward",525
Page 27,"12 Th e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s and punishment possibilities of a situation; the neurons in this part of the cortex fire wildly when there is an immediate possibility of pleasure or pain, loss or gain.17When you feel yourself drawn to a meal, a landscape, or an attractive person, or repelled by a dead animal, a bad song, or a blind date, your orbitofrontal cortex is working hard to give you an .emotional feeling of wanting to approach or to get away18The orbitofrontal cortex therefore appears to be a better candidate for the id, or for St. Pauls flesh, than for the superego or the Spirit. The importance of the orbitofrontal cortex for emotion has been further demonstrated by research on brain damage. The neurologist Antonio Damasio has studied people who, because of a stroke, tumor, or blow to the head, have lost various parts of their frontal cortex. In the 1990s, Damasio found that when certain parts of the orbitofrontal cortex are dam­ aged, patients lose most of their emotional lives. They report that when they ought to feel emotion, they feel nothing, and studies of their auto­ nomic reactions (such as those used in lie detector tests) confirm that they lack the normal flashes of bodily reaction that the rest of us experience when observing scenes of horror or beauty Yet their reasoning and logical abilities are intact. They perform normally on tests of intelligence and knowledge of social rules and moral principles.19 So what happens when these people go out into the world? Now that they are free of the distractions of emotion, do they become hyperlogical, able to see through the haze of feelings that blinds the rest of us to the path of perfect rationality? Just the opposite. They find themselves unable to make simple decisions or to set goals, and their lives fall apart. When they look out at the world and think, “What should I do now?” they see dozens of choices but lack immediate internal feelings of like or dislike. They must examine the pros and cons of every choice with their reason­ ing, but in the absence of feeling they see little reason to pick one or the other. When the rest of us look out at the world, our emotional brains have instantly and automatically appraised the possibilities. One possibil­ ity usuallyjumps out at us as the obvious best one. We need only use rea­ son to weigh the pros and cons when two or three possibilities seem equally good.",526
Page 28,"The Divided Self 13 Human rationality depends critically on sophisticated emotionality. It is only because our emotional brains works so well that our reasoning can work at all. Platos image of reason as charioteer controlling the dumb beasts of passion may overstate not only the wisdom but also the power of the charioteer. The metaphor of a rider on an elephant fits Damasio’s find- ings more closely: Reason and emotion must both work together to create intelligent behavior, but emotion (a major part of the elephant) does most of the work. When the neocortex came along, it made the rider possible, but it made the elephant much smarter, too. ^ F o u r t h D i v i s i o:n C o n t r o l l e dv s. A u t o m a t i c In the 1990s, while I was developing the elephant/rider metaphor for my­ self, the field of social psychology was coming to a similar view of the mind. After its long infatuation with information processing models and computer metaphors, psychologists began to realize that there are really two processing systems at work in the mind at all times: controlled pro­ cesses and automatic processes. Suppose you volunteered to be a subject in the following experiment.20 hirst, the experimenter hands you some word problems and tells you to come and get her when you are finished. The word problems are easy: Just unscramble sets of five words and make sentences using four of them. For example, “they her bother see usually” becomes either “they usually see her” or “they usually bother her.”A few minutes later, when you have fin­ ished the test, you go out to the hallway as instructed. The experimenter is there, but she’s engaged in a conversation with someone and isn’t making eye contact with you. What do you suppose you'll do? Well, if half the sen­ tences you unscrambled contained words related to rudeness (such as bother, brazen, aggressively), you will probably interrupt the experimenter within a minute or two to say “Hey, I'm finished. What should I do now?” Ikit if you unscrambled sentences in which the rude words were swapped with words related to politeness (“they her respect see usually”), the odds",491
Page 29,"14 Th e H a p p i n e Hy p o t h e s i s are you’ll just sit there meekly and wait until the experimenter acknowl­ edges you— ten minutes from now. Likewise, exposure to words related to the elderly makes people walk more slowly; words related to professors make people smarter at the game of Trivial Pursuit; and words related to soccer hooligans make people dumber.21And these effects don’t even depend on your consciously read­ ing the words; the same effects can occur when the words are presented subliminally, that is, flashed on a screen forjust a few hundredths of a sec­ ond, too fast for your conscious mind to register them. But some part of the mind does see the words, and it sets in motion behaviors that psychol­ ogists can measure. According to John Bargh, the pioneer in this research, these experi­ ments show that most mental processes happen automatically, without the need for conscious attention or control. Most automatic processes are completely unconscious, although some of them show a part of themselves to consciousness; for example, we are aware of the “stream of conscious­ ness”22 that seems to flow on by, following its own rules of association, without any feeling of effort or direction from the self. Bargh contrasts au­ tomatic processes with controlled processes, the kind of thinking that takes some effort, that proceeds in steps and that always plays out on the center stage of consciousness. For example, at what time would you need to leave your house to catch a 6:26 flight to London? That’s something you have to think about consciously, first choosing a means of transport to the airport and then considering rush-hour traffic, weather, and the strictness of the shoe police at the airport. You can’t depart on a hunch. But if you drive to the airport, almost everything you do on the way will be automatic: breathing, blinking, shifting in your seat, daydreaming, keeping enough distance between you and the car in front of you, even scowling and curs­ ing slower drivers. Controlled processing is limited—we can think consciously about one thing at a time only— but automatic processes run in parallel and can handle many tasks at once. If the mind performs hundreds of operations each second, all but one of them must be handled automatically. So what is the relationship between controlled and automatic processing? Is con­ trolled processing the wise boss, king, or CEO handling the most impor-",522
Page 30,"The Divided Self 15 Iant questions and setting policy with foresight for the dumber automatic processes to carry out? No, that would bring us right back to the Pro­ methean script and divine reason. To dispel the Promethean script once and for all, it will help to go back in time and look at why we have these Iwo processes, why we have a small rider and a large elephant. When the first clumps of neurons were forming the firstbrains more than 600 million years ago, these clumps must have conferred some advantage on Ihe organisms that had them because brains have proliferated ever since. Brains are adaptive because they integrate information from various parts of Ihe animals body to respond quickly and automatically to threats and oppor- Iunities in the environment. By the time we reach 3 million years ago, the Isarth was full of animals with extraordinarily sophisticated automatic abili- lies, among them birds that could navigate by star positions, ants that could cooperate to fight wars and run fungus farms, and several Species of hom- inids that had begun to make tools. Many of these creatures possessed sys- lems of communication, but none of them had developed language. Controlled processing requires language. You can have bits and pieces of thought through images, but to plan something complex, to weigh the pros and cons of different paths, or to analyze the causes of past successes and failures, you need words. Nobody knows how long ago human beings de­ veloped language, but most estimates range from around 2 million years ago, when hominid brains became much bigger, to as recently as 40,000 years ago, the time of cave paintings and other artifacts that reveal unmis- lakably modern human minds.23Whichever end of that range you favor, language, reasoning, and conscious planning arrived in the most recent eye-blink of evolution. They are like new software, Rider version 1.0. The language parts work well, but there are still a lot of bugs in the reasoning and planning programs,24Automatic processes, on the other hand, have been through thousands of product cycles and are nearly perfect. This*dif­ ference in maturity between automatic and controlled processes helps ex­ plain why we have inexpensive computers that can solve logic, math, and chess problems better than any human beings can {most of us struggle with these tasks), but none of our robots, no matter how costly, can walk ihrough the woods as well as the average six-year-dld child (our perceptual and motor systems are superb).",530
Page 31,"16 T h e H a pp i n e sH y p o t h e s i s Evolution never looks ahead. It can’t plan the best way to travel from point A to point B. Instead, small changes to existing forms arise (by ge­ netic mutation), and spread within a population to the extent that they help organisms respond more effectively to current conditions. When lan­ guage evolved, the human brain was not reengineered to hand over the reins of power to the rider (conscious verbal thinking). Things were already working pretty well, and linguistic ability spread to the extent that it helped the elephant do something important in a better way. The rider evolved to serve to the elephant. But whatever its origin, once we had it, language was a powerful tool that could be used in new ways, and evolution then se­ lected those individuals who got the best use out of it. One use of language is that it partially freed humans from “stimulus con­ trol.” Behaviorists such as B. F. Skinner were able to explain much of the behavior of animals as a set of connections between stimuli and responses. Some of these connections are innate, such as when the sight or smell of an animals natural food triggers hunger and eating. Other connections are learned, as demonstrated by Ivan Pavlovs dogs, who salivated at the sound of abell that had earlier announced the arrival offood. The behaviorists saw animals as slaves to their environments and learning histories who blindly respond to the reward properties of whatever they encounter. The behavior­ ists thought that people were no different from other animals. In this view, St. Pauls lament could be restated as: “My flesh is under stimulus control.” It is no accident that we find the carnal pleasures so rewarding. Our brains, like rat brains, are wired so that food and sex give us little bursts of dopamine, the neurotransmitter that is the brains way of making us enjoy the activities that are good for the survival of our genes.25Plato’s“bad”horse plays an important role in pulling us toward these things, which helped our ancestors survive and succeed in becoming our ancestors. But the behaviorists were not exactly right about people. The controlled system allows people to think about long-term goals and thereby escape the tyranny of the here-and-now, the automatic triggering of temptation by the sight of tempting objects. People can imagine alternatives that are not visu­ ally present; they can weigh long-term health risks against present pleasures, and they can learn in conversation about which choices will bring success",526
Page 32,"The Divided Self 17 and prestige. Unfortunately, the behaviorists were not entirely wrong about people, either. For although the controlled systenr does not conform to be- luiviorist principles, it also has relatively little power to cause behavior. The automatic system was shaped by natural selection to trigger quick and reli­ able action, and it includes parts of the brain that make us feel pleasure and pain (such as the orbitofrontal cortex) and that trigger survival-related moti­ vations (such as the hypothalamus). The automatic system has its finger on the dopamine release button. The controlled system, in contrast, is better seen as an advisor. Its a rider placed on the elephants back to help the ele­ phant make better choices. The rider can see farther into the future, and the rider can learn valuable information by talking to other riders or by reading maps, but the rider cannot order the elephant around against its will. I be­ lieve the Scottish philosopher David Hume was closer to the truth than was Platowhen he said, “Reason is, and ought only to be the slaveof the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve-and obey them.”26 In sum, the rider is an advisor or servant; not a king, president, or chario­ teerwith afirm grip on the reins. The rider is Gazzaniga’sinterpreter module; it is conscious, controlled thought. The elephant, in contrast, is everything else. The elephant includes the gut feelings, visceral reactions, emotions, and intuitions that comprise much""of the automatic system. The elephant and the rider each have their own intelligence, and when they work together well they enable the unique brilliance of human beings. But they don’t al­ ways work together well. Here are three quirks of daily life that illustrate the sometimes complex relationship between the rider and the elephant. F a i l u r e so f S e l f C o n t r o l Imagine that it is 1970 and you are afour-year-oldchild in an experiment be­ ingconducted byWalter Mischel at Stanford University.You arebrought into a room at your preschool where a nice man gives you toys and plays with you lor a while. Then the man asks you, first, whether you like marshmallows (you do), and, then, whether you’d rather have this plate here with one marshmallow or that plate there with two marshmallows (that one, of",519
Page 33,"18 T h e H a p p i n e Hy p o t h e s i s course). Then the man tells you that he has to go out of the room for a little while, and if you can wait until he comes back, you can have the two marsh­ mallows. If you don’t want to wait, you can ring this bell heire, and he’ll come right back and give you the plate with one; but if you do that, you cant have the two. The man leaves. You stare at the marshmallows. You salivate. You want. You fight your wanting. If you are like most four-year-olds, you can hold out for only a few minutes. Then you ring the bell. Now lets jump ahead to 1985. Mischel has mailed your parents a ques­ tionnaire asking them to report on your personality, your ability to delay gratification and deal with frustration, and your performance on your col­ lege entrance exams (the Scholastic Aptitude Test). Your parents return the questionnaire. Mischel discovers that the number of seconds you waited to ring the bell in 1970 predicts not only what your parents say about you as a teenager but also the likelihood that you were admitted to a top university. Children who were able to overcome stimulus control and delay gratifica­ tion for a few extra minutes in 1970 were better able to resist temptation as teenagers, to focus on their studies, and to control themselves when things didn’t go the way they wanted.27 What was their secret?A large part of it was strategy—the ways that chil­ dren used their limited mental control to shift attention. In later studies, Mischel discovered that the successful children were those who looked away from the temptation or were able to think about other enjoyable activ­ ities.28These thinking skills are an aspect of emotional intelligence—an ability to understand and regulate one’sown feelings and desires.29An emo­ tionally intelligent person has a skilled rider who knows how to distract and coax the elephant without having to engage in a direct contest of wills. It’s hard for the controlled system to beat the automatic system by willpower alone; like a tired muscle,30 the former soon wears down and caves in, but the latter runs automatically, effortlessly, and endlessly Once you understand the power of stimulus control, you can use it to your ad­ vantage by changing the stimuli in your environment and avoiding undesir­ able ones; or, if that’s not possible, by filling your consciousness with thoughts about their less tempting aspects. Buddhism, for example, in an effort to break people’s carnal attachment to their own (and others’) flesh, developed methods of meditating on decaying corpses.31 By choosing to",571
Page 34,"The Divided Self 19 stare at something that revolts the automatic system, the rider can begin to change what the elephant will want in the future. M e n t a l In t r u s i o n s Edgar Allan Poe understood the divided mind. In The Imp of the Perverse, Poes protagonist carries out the perfect murder, inherits the dead mans es­ tate, and livesforyears in healthyenjoyment of his ill-gottengains. Whenever thoughts of the murder appear on the fringes of his consciousness, he mur­ murs to himself, “I am safe.”All is well until the day he remodels his mantra to “I am safe—yes—if I be not fool enough to make open confession.”With that thought, he comes undone. He tries to suppress the thought of confess­ ing, but the harder he tries, the more insistent the thought becomes. He pan­ ics, he starts running, people start chasing him, he blacks out, and, when he returns to his senses, he is told that he has made a full confession. I love this story, for its title above all else. Whenever I am on a cliff, a rooftop, or a high balcony, the imp of the perverse whispers in my ear, ""Jump.” Its not a command, its just a word that pops into my conscious­ ness. When I’m at a dinner party sitting next to someone I respect, the imp works hard to suggest the most inappropriate things I could possibly say. Who or what is the imp? Dan Wegner, one of the most perverse and cre- iitive social psychologists, has dragged the imp into the lab and made it confess to being an aspect of automatic processing. In Wegners studies, participants are asked to try hardjiot to think about something, such as a white bear, or food, or a stereotype. This is hard to do. More important, the moment one stops trying to suppress a thought, the thought comes flooding in and becomes even harder to banish. In other words, Wegner creates minor obsessions in his lab byinstructing people not to obsess. Wegner explains this effect as an “ironic process”of mental con- liol.*2When controlled processing tries to influence thought (“Don’t think iibout a white beat!”), it sets up an explicit goal. And whenever one pursues n goal, a part of the mind automatically monitors progress, so that it can or­ der corrections or know when success has been achieved. When that goal is nn action in the world (such as arrivingat the airport on time), this feedback",546
Page 35,"2 0 T hu H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s system works well. But when the goal is mental, it backfires. Automatic pro­ cesses continually check: “Am I not thinking about awhite bear?”As the act of monitoring for the absence of the thought introduces the thought, the person must try even harder to divert consciousness. Automatic and con­ trolled processes end up working at cross purposes, firing each other up to ever greater exertions. But because controlled processes tire quickly, even­ tually the inexhaustible automatic processes run unopposed, conjuring up herds of white bears. Thus, the attempt to remove an unpleasant thought can guarantee it a place on your frequent-play list of mental ruminations. Now, backto me at that dinner party. My simple thought “don’t make afool of yourself’ triggers automatic processes looking for signs of foolishness. I know that it would be stupid to comment on that mole on his forehead, or to say“I loveyou,”or to scream obscenities. And up in consciousness, I become aware of three thoughts: comment on the mole, say“I loveyou,”or screamob­ scenities. These are not commands, just ideas that pop into my head. Freud based much of his theory of psychoanalysis on such mental intrusions and free associations, and he found they often have sexual or aggressive content. But Wegner’sresearch offers a simpler and more innocent explanation: Auto­ matic processes generate thousands of thoughts and images every day, often through random association. The ones that get stuck are the ones that partic­ ularly shock us, the ones we try to suppress or deny The reason we suppress them is not that we know, deep down, that they’re true (although some may be), but that they are scary or shameful. Yet once we have tried and failed to suppress them, theycan become the sorts of obsessive thoughts that make us believe in Freudian notions of a dark and evil unconscious mind. T h e D i f f i c u l t o f W i n n i n ga n A r g u m e n t Consider the following story: Julie and Mark are sister and brother. They are traveling together in France on summer vacation from college. One night they are staying alone in a cabin near the beach. They decide that it would be interesting",497
Page 36,"The Divided Self 21 and fun if they tried making love. At the veryleast, it would be a new ex- - perience for each of them. Julie is already taking birth control pills, but Mark uses a condom, too, just to be safe. They both enjoy making love, but decide not to do it again. They keep that night as a special secret, which makes them feel even closer to each other. Do you think it is acceptable for two consenting adults, who happen to be siblings, to make love? If you are like most people in my studies,33you immediately answered no. But how would you justify that judgment? People often reach first for the argument that incestuous sex leads to off­ spring that suffer genetic abnormalities. When I point out that the siblings used two forms of birth control, however, no one says, “Oh, well, in that ease its okay” Instead, people begin searching for other arguments, for ex- nmple, “Its going to harm their relationship.”When I respond that in this ease the sex has made the relationship stronger, people just scratch their Ileads, frown, and say, “I know its wrong, I’m just having a hard time ex­ plaining why” The point of these studies is that moral judgment is like aesthetic judg­ ment. When you see a painting, you usually know instantly and automati­ cally whether you like it. If someone asks you to explain your judgment, you confabulate. You don’t really know why you think something is beauti­ ful, but your interpreter module (the rider) is skilled at making up reasons, us Gazzaniga found in his split-brain studies. You search for a plausible rea­ son for liking the painting, and you latch on to the first reason that makes sense (maybe something vague about color, or light, or the reflection of the painter in the clown’s shiny nose). Moral arguments are much the same: Two people feel strongly about an issue, their feelings come first, and their reasons are invented on the fly to throw at each other. When you refute a person’s argument, does she generally change her mind and agree with you? Of course not, because the argument you defeated was not the cause of her position; it was made up after the judgment was already made. If you listen closely to moral arguments, you can sometimes hear some­ thing surprising: that it is really the elephant holding theorems, guiding Ihe rider. It is the elephant who decides what is good or bad, beautiful or ugly. Gut feelings, intuitions, and snap judgments happen constantly and",545

In moral arguments, the rider goes beyond being just an advisor to the elephant; he becomes a lawyer, fighting in the court of public opinion to persuade others of the elephants point of view. This, then, is our situation, lamented by St. Paul, Buddha, Ovid, and so many others. Our minds are loose confederations of parts, but we identify with and pay too much attention to one part: conscious verbal thinking. We are like the proverbial drunken man looking for his car keys under the street light. (“Did you drop them here?”asks the cop. “No”says the man, “I dropped them back there in the alley, but the light is better over here.”) Be­ cause we can see only one little corner of the minds vast operation, we are surprised when urges, wishes, and temptations emerge, seemingly from nowhere. We make pronouncements, vows, and resolutions, and then are surprised by our own powerlessness to carry them out. We sometimes fall into the view that we are fighting with our unconscious, our id, or our ani­ mal self But reallywe are the whole thing. We are the rider, and we are the elephant. Both have their strengths and special skills. The rest of this book is about how complex and partly clueless creatures such as ourselves can get along with each other (chapters 3 and 4), find happiness (chapters 5 and 6), grow psychologically and morally (chapters 7 and 8), and find pur­ pose and meaning in our lives (chapters 9 and 10). But first we have to fig­ ure out why the elephant is such a pessimist.",397

The best-selling self-help advisor of all time, Dale Carnegie, writing in 1944, called the last eight words of the Aurelius quote “eight words that can transform your life.”3 More recently, on television and the Internet, ""Dr. Phil” (Phil McGraw) stated as one of his ten “laws of life”: “There is no reality, only perception.”4 Self-help books and seminars sometimes seem to consist of little more than lecturing and hectoring people until they understand this idea and its implications for their lives. It can be in­ spiring to watch: Often a moment comes when a person consumed by years of resentment, pain, and anger realizes that her father (for example)",280
Page 39,"24 T i mH a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s didn’t directly hurt her when he abandoned the family; all he did was move out of the house. His action was morally wrong, but the pain came from her reactions to the event, and if she can change those reactions, she can leave behind twenty years of pain and perhaps even get to know her father. The art of pop psychology is to develop a method (beyond lecturing and hectoring) that guides people to that realization. This art is old. Consider Anicius Boethius, bom to one of the most dis­ tinguished Roman families in 480 CE, four years after Rome fell to the Goths. Boethius received the best education available in his day and suc­ cessfully pursued careers in philosophy and public service. He wrote or translated dozens of works on math, science, logic, and theology, at the same time rising to become consul of Rome (the highest elected office) in 510. He was wealthy, he married well, and his sons went on to become consuls themselves. But in 523, at the peak of his power and fortune, Boethius was accused of treason toward the Ostrogoth King Theodoric for remaining loyal to Rome and its Senate. Condemned by the cowardly Sen­ ate he had tried to defend, Boethius was stripped of his wealth and honor, thrown into prison on a remote island, and executed in 524. To take something “philosophically” means to accept a great misfortune without weeping or even suffering. We use this term in part because of the calmness, self-control, and courage that three ancient philosophers— Socrates, Seneca, and Boethius— showed while they awaited their exe­ cutions. But in The Consolation ofPhilosophy, which Boethius wrote while in prison, he confessed that at first he was anything but philosophical. He wept and wrote poems about weeping. He cursed injustice, and old age, and the Goddess of Fortune, who had blessed him and then aban­ doned him. Then one night, while Boethius is wallowing in his wretchedness, the majestic apparition of Lady Philosophy visits him and proceeds to chide him for his unphilosophical behavior. Lady Philosophy then guides Boe­ thius through reinterpretations that foreshadow modern cognitive therapy (described below). She begins by asking Boethius to think about his rela­ tionship with the Goddess of Fortune. Philosophy reminds Boethius that Fortune is fickle, coming and going as she pleases. Boethius took Fortune",560

I,;idy Philosophy presents Fortunes defense: Why should I alone be deprived ofmy rights? The heavens are permitted to grant bright days, then blot them out with dark nights; the year may decorate the face of the earth with flowers and fruits, then make it bar­ ren again with clouds and frost; the sea is allowed to invite the sailor with fair weather, then terrify him with storms. Shall I, then, permit mans insatiable cupidity to tie me down to a sameness that is alien to my habits?5 Lady Philosophy reframes change as normal and as the right of Fortune. (""The whole universe is change,”Aurelius had said.) Boethius was fortu- nilie; now he is not. That is no cause for anger. Rather, he should be grate­ ful that he enjoyed Fortune for so long, and he should be calm now that she has left him: “No man can ever be secure until he has been forsaken by lortune.”6 Lady Philosophy tries several other reframing tactics. She points out Ihiit his wife, sons, and father are each dearer to him than his own life, and nil lour still live. She helps him see that adverse fortune is more beneficial ihun good fortune; the latter only makes men greedy for more, but adver­ sity makes them strong. And she draws Boethius's imagination far up into the heavens so that he can look down on the Earth and see it as a tiny speck on which even tinier people play out their comical and ultimately in­ significant ambitions. She gets him to admit that riches and fame bring inixiety and avarice, not peace and happiness. After being shown these new perspectives and having his old assumptions challenged, Boethius is finally prepared to absorb the greatest lesson of all, the lesson Buddha and Aure­ lius had taught centuries earlier: “Nothing is miserable unless you think it so; and on the other hand, nothing brings happiness unless you are content with it.”7When he takes this lesson to heart, Boethius frees himself from Ins mental prison. He regains his composure, writes a book that has com- Inrlcd people for centuries, and faces his death With dignity.",509
Page 41,"26 T h e H a p p i n e Hy p o t h e s i s I don’t mean to imply that The Consolation of Philosophy is just Roman pop psychology, but it does tell a story of freedom through insight that I would like to question. In the previous chapter, I suggested that our divided self is like a rider on the back of an elephant, and I said that we give far too much importance to the rider—conscious thought. Lady Philosophy, like the pop psychology gurus of today, was working with the rider, guiding him to a moment of cognitive insight and reframing. Yet, if you have ever achieved such dramatic insights into your own life and resolved to change your ways or your outlook, you probably found that, three months later, you were right back where you started. Epiphanies can be life-altering,8but most fade in days or weeks. The rider can’t just decide to change and then order the elephant to go along,with the program. Lasting change can come only by retraining the elephant, and that’shard to do. When pop psychology programs are successful in helping people, which they sometimes are, they succeed not because of the initial moment of insight but because they find ways to alter people’s behavior over the following months. They keep people involved with the program long enough to retrain the, elephant. This chapter is about why the elephant tends toward worry and pessimism in so many people, and about three tools that the rider can use to retrain it. T h e L i k e-o - M e t e r The most important words in the elephant’s language are “like” and “dis­ like,” or “approach” and “withdraw.” Even the simplest animal must make decisions at every moment: Left or right? Go or stop? Eat or don’t eat? An­ imals with brains complex enough to have emotions make these decisions effortlessly and automatically by having what is sometimes called a “like-o- meter” running in their heads at all times. If a monkey tasting a new fruit feels a sweet sensation, its like-o-meter registers “I like it”; the monkey feels pleasure and bites right in. If the taste is bitter, a flash of displeasure discourages further eating. There’s no need for a weighing of pros and cons, or for a reasoning system. Just flashes of pleasure and displeasure. We humans have a like-o-meter too, and it’s always running. Its influ­ ence is subtle, but careful experiments show that you have a like-dislike re­",530
Page 42,"Changing YourMind 27 action to everything you are experiencing, even if youre not aware of the experience. For example, suppose you are a participant in an experiment 011what is known as “affective priming.” You sit in front of a computer screen and stare at a dot in the center. Every few seconds, a word is flashed over the dot. All you have to do is tap a key with your left hand if the word means something good or likable (such as garden, hope, fun), or tap a key with your right hand if the word means something bad or dislikable (death, tyranny, boredom). It seems easy, but for some reason you find yourself hesitating for a split second on some of the words. Unbeknownst to you, the computer is also flashing up another word, right on the dot, just for a few hundredths of a second before putting up the target word youre rating. Though these words are presented subliminally (below the level of your awareness), your intuitive system is so fast that it reads and reacts to them with a like-o-meter rating. If the subliminal word isfear, it would register negative on your like-o-meter, making you feel a tiny flash of displeasure; and then, a split second later, when you see the word boredom, you would more quickly say that boredom is bad. Your negative evaluation of boredom has been facilitated, or “primed,” by your tiny flash of negativity toward fear. If, however, the word following/ear isgarden, you would take longer to say that garden is good, because of the time it takes for your like-o-meter to shift from bad to good.9 The discovery of affective priming in the 1980s opened up a world of in­ direct measurement in psychology. It became possible to bypass the rider and talk directly to the elephant, and what the elephant has to say is some­ times disturbing. For example, what if, instead of flashing subliminal words, we use photographs of black and white faces? Researchers have found that Americans of all ages, classes, and political affiliations react with a flash of negativity to black faces or to other images and words as­ sociated with African-American culture.10People who report being unprej­ udiced against blacks show, on average, a slightly smaller automatic prejudice, but apparently the rider and the elephant each have an opinion. (You can test your own elephant at: www.projectimplicit.com.) Even many African Americans show this implicit prejudice, although others show an implicit preference for black faces and names. Orubalance, African Ameri­ cans come Out with no implicit bias either way.",555
Page 43,"2 8 Th e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s One of the most bizarre demonstrations of the like-o-meter in action comes from the work of Brett Pelham,11who has discovered that ones like- o-meter is triggered by ones own name. Whenever you see or hear a word that resembles your name, a little flash of pleasure biases you toward think­ ing the thing is good. So when a man named Dennis is considering a career, he ponders the possibilities: “Lawyer, doctor, banker, dentist . . . dentist . . . something about dentist justfeels right.”And, in fact, people named Dennis or Denise are slightly more likely than people with other names to become dentists. Men named Lawrence and women named Laurie are more likely to become lawyers. Louis and Louise are more likely to move to Louisiana or St. Louis, and George and Georgina are more likely to move to Georgia. The own-name preference even shows up in marriage records: People are slightly more likely to marry people whose names sound like their own, even if the similarityisjust sharing afirst initial. WTien Pelham presented his findings to my academic department, I was shocked to realize that most of the married people in the room illustrated his claim: Jerry and Judy, Brian and Bethany, and the winners were me, Jon, and my wife, Jayne. The unsettling implication of Pelhams work is that the three biggest decisions most of us make—what to do with our lives, where to live, and whom to marry—can all be influenced (even if only slightly) by something as trivial as the sound of a name. Life is indeed what we deem it, but the deeming happens quickly and unconsciously. The elephant reacts instinc­ tively and steers the rider toward a new destination. N e g a t i v i t B i a s Clinical psychologists sometimes say that two kinds of people seek ther­ apy: those who need tightening, and those who need loosening. But for every patient seeking help in becoming more organized, self-controlled, and responsible about her future, there is a waiting room full of people hoping to loosen up, lighten up, and worry less about the stupid things they said at yesterdays staff meeting or about the rejection they are sure will follow tomorrows lunch date. For most people, the elephant sees too many things as bad and not enough as good.",507
Page 44,"Changing YourMind 29 It makes sense. If you were designing the mind ofa fish, would you have it respond as strongly to opportunities as to threats? No way. The cost of miss­ ing a cue that signals food is low; odds are that there are other fish in the sea, mid one mistake won’t lead to starvation. The cost of missing the sign of a nearby predator, however, can be catastrophic. Game over, end of the line for those genes. Of course, evolution has no designer, but minds created by nat­ ural selection end up looking (to us) as though they were designed because they generally produce behavior that is flexibly adaptive in their ecological niches. (See Steven Pinker12on how natural selection designs without a de­ signer.) Some commonalities of animal life even create similarities across species that we might call design principles. One such principle is that bad is siranger than good. Responses to threats and unpleasantness are faster, stronger, and harder to inhibit than responses to opportunities and pleasures. This principle, called “negativity bias,”13 shows up all over psychology. In marital interactions, it takes at least five good or constructive actions to make up for the damage done by one critical or destructive act.14In finan­ cial transactions and gambles, the pleasure of gaining a certain amount of money is smaller than the pain of losing the same amount.15In evaluating a persons character, people estimate that it would take twenty-five acts of life-saving heroism to make up for one act of murder.16When preparing a meal, food is easily contaminated (by a single cockroach antenna), but dif­ ficult to purify. Over and over again, psychologists find that the human mind reacts to bad things more quickly, strongly, and persistently than to equivalent good things. We cant just will ourselves to see everything as good because our minds are wired to find and react to threats, violations, and setbacks. As Ben Franklin said: “We are not so sensible of the greatest Ilealth as of the least Sickness.”17 I lere’s another candidate for a design principle of animal life: Opposing systems push against each other to reach a balance point, but the balance point is adjustable. When you move your arm, one set of muscles extends it and another contracts it. Both are always slightly tensed, ready for action. Your heart rate and breathing are regulated by an autonomic nervous system composed of two subsystems that push your organs in opposite directions: The sympathetic system prepares your body for “fight or flight” and the parasympathetic system calms you down. Both are active all the time, in",550
Page 45,"30 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s different ratios. Your behavior is governed by opposing motivational systems: an approach system, which triggers positive emotions and makes you want to move toward certain things; and a withdrawal system, which triggers neg­ ative emotions and makes you want to pull back or avoid other things. Both systems arealways active, monitoring the environment, and the two systems can produce opposing motives at the same time18(as when you feel ambiva­ lence), but their relative balance determines which way you move. (The “like-o-meter” is a metaphor for this balancing process and its subtle moment-by-moment fluctuations.) The balance can shift in an instant: You are drawn by curiosity to an accident scene, but then recoil in horror when you see the blood that you could not have been surprised to see. You want to talk to a stranger, but you find yourself suddenly paralyzed when you ap­ proach that person. The withdrawal system can quickly shoot up to full power,19overtaking the slower (and generally weaker) approach system. One reason the withdrawal system is so quick and compelling is that it gets first crackat all incoming information. All neural impulses from the eyes and ears go first to the thalamus, a kind of central switching station in the brain. From the thalamus, neural impulses are sent out to special sensory processingareas in the cortex; and from those areas, information is relayed to the frontal cortex, where it is integrated with other higher mental processes and your ongoing stream of consciousness. If at the end of this process you become aware of a hissing snake in front of you, you could decide to run away and then order your legs to start moving. But because neural impulses move only at about thirty meters per second, this fairly long path, including decision time, could easily take a second or two. It’seasy to see why a neural shortcut would be advantageous, and the amygdala is that shortcut. The amygdala, sittingjust under the thalamus, dips into the river of unprocessed information flowing through the thalamus, and it responds to patterns that in the past were associated with danger. The amygdala has a direct connection to the part of the brainstem that activates the fight-or-flight response, and if the amygdala finds apattern that was part of a previous fear episode (such as the sound of a hiss), it orders the body to red alert.20 You have felt this happen. If you have ever thought you were alone in a room and then heard a voice behind you, or if you have ever seen a horror",550
Page 46,"Changing YourMind 31 movie in which a knife-wielding maniac jumps into the frame without a musical forewarning, you probably flinched, and your heart rate shot up. Your body reacted with fear (via the quick amygdala path) in the first tenth of a second before you could make sense of the event (via the slower corti­ cal path) in the next nine-tenths of a second. Though the amygdala does process some positive information, the brain has no, equivalent “green nlcrt” system to notify you instantly of a delicious meal or a likely mate. Such appraisals can take a second or two. Once again, bad is stronger arid luster than good. The elephant reacts before the rider even sees the snake on the path. Although you can tell yourself that you are not afraid of snakes, if your elephant fears them and rears up, yoii’ll still be thrown. One final point about the amygdala: Not only does it reach down to the brainstem to trigger a response to danger but it reaches up to the frontal cortex to change your thinking. It shifts the entire brain over to a with­ drawal orientation. There is a two-way street between emotions and con­ scious thoughts: Thoughts can cause emotions (as when you reflect on a foolish thing you said), but emotions can also cause thoughts, primarily by laising mental filters that bias subsequent information processing. A flash of fear makes you extra vigilant for additional threats; you look at the world llirough a filter that interprets ambiguous events as possible dangers. A flash of anger toward someone raises a filter through which you see every- 1ling the offending person says or does as a further insult or transgression. Icclings of sadness blind you to all pleasures and opportunities. As one fa­ mous depressive put it: “How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable seem to me all the uses of this world!”21So when Shakespeare’s Hamlet later offers his own paraphrase of Marcus Aurelius—“There is nothing either good or had but thinking makes it so”22—he is right, but he might have added that his negative emotions are making his thinking make everything bad. T h e C o r t i c a lL o t t e r y Ilamlet was unlucky. His uncle and his mother conspired to murder his fa- iIut, the king. But his long and deep depressive reaction to this setback",514
Page 47,"32 T h e H a p p i n e Hy p o t h e s i s suggests that he was unlucky in another way too: He was by nature a pessimist. When it comes to explaining personality, its always true that nature and nurture work together. But its also true that nature plays a bigger role than most people-realize. Consider the identical twin sisters Daphne and Bar­ bara. Raised outside London, they both left school at the age of fourteen, went to work in local government, met their future husbands at the age of sixteen at local town hall dances, suffered miscarriages at the same time, and then each gave birth to two boys and a girl. They feared many of the same things (blood and heights) and exhibited unusual habits (each drank her coffee cold; each developed the habit of pushing up her nose with the palm of the hand, a gesture they both called “squidging”). None of this may surprise you until you learn that separate families'had adopted Daphne and Barbara as infants; neither even knew of the others existence until they were reunited at the age of forty When they finally did meet, they were wearing almost identical clothing.23 Such strings of coincidences are common among identical twins who were separated at birth, but they do not happen among fraternal twins who were similarly separated.24On just about every trait that has been stud­ ied, identical twins (who share all their genes and spend the same nine months in the same womb) are more similar than same-sex fraternal twins (who share only half their genes and spend the same nine months in the same womb). This finding means that genes make at least some contribution to nearly every trait. Whether the trait is intelligence, extroversion, fearful­ ness, religiosity, political leaning, liking forjazz, or dislike of spicy foods, iden­ tical twins are more similar than fraternal twins, and they are usually almost as similar if they were separated at birth 25Genes are not blueprints specify­ ing the structure of a person; they are better thought of as recipes for produc­ ing a person over many years.26Because identical twins are created from the same recipe, their brains end up being fairly similar (though not identical), and these similar brains produce many of the same idiosyncratic behaviors. Fraternal twins, on the other hand, are made from two different recipes that happen to share half their instructions. Fraternal twins don’t end up being 50 percent similar to each other; they end up with radically different brains,",532
Page 48,"Changing Your Mind 33 iiiid therefore radically different personalities—almost as different as people IVomunrelated families.27 Daphne and Barbara came to be known as the “giggle twins.” Both have sunny personalities and a habit of bursting into laughter in mid-sentence. Ihey won the cortical lottery—their brains were preconfigured to see good in the world. Other pairs of twins, however, were born to look on the dark side. In fact, happiness is one of the most highly heritable aspects of per­ sonality. Twin studies generally show that from 50 percent to 80 percent of nil the variance among people in their average levels of happiness can be explained by differences in their genes rather than in their life experi­ ences.28(Particular episodes ofjoy or depression, however, must usually be understood by looking at how life events interact with a persons emotional predisposition.) A persons average or typical level of happiness is that persons “affective slyle.” (“Affect” refers to the felt or experienced part of emotion.) Your af­ fective style reflects the everyday balance of power between your approach system and your withdrawal system, and this balance can be read right Irom your forehead. It has long been known from studies of brainwaves Ihat most people show an asymmetry: more activity either in the right frontal cortex or in the left frontal cortex. In the late 1980s, Richard David­ son at the University of Wisconsin discovered that these asymmetries cor­ related with a persons general tendencies to experience positive and negative emotions. People showing more of a certain kind of brainwave coming through the left side of the forehead reported feeling more happi­ ness in their daily lives and less fear, anxiety, and shame than people ex­ hibiting higher activity on the right side. Later research showed that these cortical “lefties” are less subject to depression and recover more quickly from negative experiences.29The difference between cortical righties and lefties can be seen even in infants: Ten-month-old babies showing more activity on the right side are more likely to crywhen separated briefly from Iheir mothers.30And this difference in infancy appears to reflect an aspect of personality that is stable, for most people, all the way through adult­ hood.31 Babies who show a Jot more activity on the right side of the fore­ head become toddlers who are more anxious about novel situations; as",499
Page 49,"34 T h e H a p p i n eHsy p o t h e s i s teenagers, they are more likely to be fearful about dating and social activi­ ties; and, finally, as adults, they are more likely to need psychotherapy to loosen up. Having lost out in the cortical lottery, they will struggle all their lives to weaken the grip of an overactive withdrawal system. Once when a friend of mine with a negative affective style was bemoaning her life situa­ tion, someone suggested that a move to a different city would suit her well. “No,” she said, “I can be unhappy anywhere.” She might as well have quoted John Miltons paraphrase of Aurelius: “The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.”32 S can your B rain Which set of statements is more true of you?

Page 50,"Changing YourMind 35 How t o C h a n g e Y o u r M i n d [f I had an identical twin brother, he would probably dress badly. I have al­ ways hated shopping, and I can recognize only six colors by name. Several times I have resolved toimprove my style, and have even acceded to womens requests to take me shopping, but it was no use. Each time I quickly re­ turned to my familiar ways, which were stuck in the early 1980s. I couldn’t just decide to change, to become something I’m not, by sheer force of will. Instead, I found a more roundabout way to change: I got married. Now I have a closet full of nice clothes, a fewpairings that I have memorized as ap­ propriate choices, and a style consultant who recommends variations. You can change your affective style too—but again, you can’t do it by sheer force of will. You have to do something that will change your reper­ toire of available thoughts. Here are three of the best methods for doing so: meditation, cognitive therapy, and Prozac. All three are effective because they work on the elephant. Meditation Suppose you read about a pill that you could take once a day to reduce anx­ iety and increase your contentment. Would you take it? Suppose further that the pill has a great variety of side effects, all of them good: increased self-esteem, empathy, and trust; it even improves mempry. Suppose, finally, that the pill is all natural and costs nothing. Now would you take it? The pill exists. It is meditation.33 It has been discovered by many reli­ gious traditions and was in use in India long before Buddha, but Buddhism brought it into mainstream Western culture. There are many kinds of med­ itation, but they all have in common a conscious attempt to focus attention in a nonanalytical way.34It sounds easy: Sit still (in most forms) and focus awareness only on your breathing, or on a word, or on an image, and let no other words, ideas, or images arise in consciousness. Meditation is, how­ ever, extraordinarily difficult at first, and confronting your repeated failures in the first weeks teaches the rider lessons in humility and patience. The goal of meditation is to change automatic thought processes, thereby tam­ ing the elephant. And the proof of taming is the breaking of attachments.",511
Page 51,"36 T h e Ha p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s My dog Andy has two main attachments, through which he interprets everything that happens in my house: eating meat and not being left alone. If my wife and I stand near the front door, he becomes anxious. If we pick up our keys, open the door, and say, “Be a good boy,” his tail, head, and somehow even his hips droop pathetically toward the floor. But if we then say, “Andy, come,” he’s electrified with joy and shoots past us through the doorway. Andys fear of being left alone gives him many moments of anxiety throughout the day, a few hours of despair (when he is left alone), and a few minutes of joy (each tirtie his solitude is relieved). Andys pleasures and pains are determined by the choices my wife and I make. If bad is stronger than good, then Andy suffers more from separation than he bene­ fits from reunion. Most people have many more attachments than Andy; but, according to Buddhism, human psychology is similar tp Andys in many ways. Because Rachel wants to be respected, she lives in constant vigilance for signs of dis­ respect, and she aches for days after a possible violation. She may enjoy be­ ing treated with respect, but disrespect hurts more on average than respect feels good. Charles wants money and lives in a constant state of vigilance for chances to make it: He loses sleep over fines, losses, or transactions that he thinks did not get him the best possible deal. Once again, losses loom larger than gains, so even if Charles grows steadily wealthier, thoughts about money may on average give him more unhappiness than happiness. For Buddha, attachments are like a game of roulette in which someone else spins the wheel and the game is rigged: The more you play, the more you lose. The only way to win is to step away from the table. And the only way to step away, to make yourself not react to the ups and downs of life, is to meditate and tame the mind. Although you give up the pleasures of win­ ning, you also give up the larger pains of losing. In chapter 5 I’1 question whether this is really a good tradeoff for most people. For now the important point is that Buddha made a psychological discovery that he and his followers embedded in a philosophy and a reli­ gion. They have been generous with it, teaching it to people of all faiths and of no faith. The discovery is that meditation tames and calms the ele­ phant. Meditation done every day for several months can help you reduce substantially the frequency of fearful, negative, and grasping thoughts,",568
Page 52,"Changing YourMind 37 thereby improving your affective style. As Buddha said: “When a man knows the solitude of silence, and feels the joy of quietness, he is then free from fear and sin.”35 Cognitive Therapy Meditation is a characteristically Eastern solution to the problems of life. Even before Buddha, the Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu had said that the road to wisdom runs through calm inaction, desireless waiting. Western approaches to problems more typically involve pulling out a tool box and trying to fix whats broken. That was Lady Philosophy’s approach with her many arguments, and reframing techniques. The toolbox was thoroughly modernized in the 1960s byAaron Beck. Beck, a psychiatrist at the University of Pennsylvania, had been trained in the Freudian approach in which “the child is father to the man.”What­ ever ails you is caused by events in your childhood, and the only way to change yourself now is to dig through repressed memories, come up with a diagnosis, and work through your unresolved conflicts. For depressed pa­ tients, however, Beck found little evidence in the scientific literature or in his own clinical practice that this approach was Working. The more space he gave them to run through their self-critical thoughts and memories of injustice, the worse they felt. But in the late 1960s, when Beck broke with standard practice and, like Lady Philosophy, questioned the legitimacy of his patients irrational and self-critical thoughts, the patients often seemed to feel better. Beck took a chance. He mapped out the distorted thought processes characteristic of depressed people and trained his patients to catch and challenge these thoughts. Beck was scorned by his Freudian colleagues, who thought he was treating the symptoms of depression with Band-Aids while letting the disease rage underneath, but his courage and persistence paid off. He created cognitive therapy,36 one of the most effective treat­ ments available for depression, anxiety, and many other problems. As I suggested in the last chapter, we often use reasoning not to find the truth but to invent arguments to support our deep and intuitive beliefs (re­ siding in the elephant). Depressed people are convinced in their hearts of three related beliefs, known as Becks “cognitive triad”of depression. These",463
Page 53,"38 T h e Ha p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s are: Tm no good,” “My world is bleak,” and “My future is hopeless.”A de­ pressed persons mind is filled with automatic thoughts supporting these dysfunctional beliefs, particularly when things goes wrong. The thought dis­ tortions were so similar across patients that Beck gave them names. Con­ sider the depressed father whose daughter falls down and bangs her head while he is watching her. He instantly flagellates himself with these thoughts: “I’m a terrible father” (this is called “personalization,” or seeing the event as a referendum on the self rather than as a minor medical issue); “Why do I always do such terrible things to my children?” (“overgenerali­ zation” combined with dichotomous “always/never” thinking); “Now shes going to have brain damage”(“magnification”); “Everyone will hate me”(“ar­ bitrary inference,”orjumping to a conclusion without evidence). Depressed people are caught in a feedback loop in which distorted thoughts cause negative feelings, which then distort thinking further. Beck’s discovery is that you can break the cycle by changing the thoughts. A big part of cognitive therapy is training clients to catch their thoughts, write them down, name the distortions, and then find alternative and more accurate ways of thinking. Over many weeks, the client’s thoughts become more realistic, the feedback loop is broken, and the client’s anxiety or de­ pression abates. Cognitive therapy works because it teaches the rider how to train the elephant rather than how to defeat it directly in an argument. On the first day of therapy, the rider doesn’t realize that the elephant is controlling him, that the elephant’s fears are driving his conscious thoughts. Over time, the client learns to use a set of tools; these include challenging automatic thoughts and engaging in simple tasks, such as go­ ing out to buy a newspaper rather than staying in bed all day ruminating. These tasks are often assigned as homework, to be done daily. (The ele­ phant learns best from daily practice; a weekly meeting with a therapist is not enough.) With each reframing, and with each simple task accom­ plished, the client receives a little reward, a little flash of relief or pleasure. And each flash of pleasure is like a peanut given to an elephant as rein­ forcement for a new behavior. You can’t win a tug of war with an angry or fearful elephant, but you can— by gradual shaping of the sort the behav­ iorists talked about—change your automatic, thoughts and, in the process, your affective style. In fact, many therapists combine cognitive therapy",570
Page 54,"Changing YourMind 39 with techniques borrowed directly from behaviorism to create what is now called “cognitive behavioral therapy.” Unlike Freud, Beck tested his theories in controlled experiments. People who underwent cognitive therapy for depression got measurably better; they got better faster than people who were put on a waiting list for therapy; and, at least in some studies, they got better faster than those who received other therapies.37When cognitive therapy is done very well it is as effective as drugs such as Prozac for the treatment of depression,38and its enormous advantage over Prozac is that when cognitive therapy stops, the benefits usually continue because the elephant has been retrained. Prozac, in contrast, works only for as long as you take it. I don’t mean to suggest that cognitive behavioral therapy isthe only psy­ chotherapy that works. Most forms of psychotherapy work to some degree, and in some studies they all seem to work equally well.39It comes down to a question of fit: Some people respond better to one therapy than another, and some psychological disorders are more effectively treated by one ther­ apy than another. If you have frequent automatic negative thoughts about yourself, your world, or your future, and if these thoughts contribute to chronic feelings of anxiety or despair, then you might find a good fit with cognitive behavioral therapy.40 Prozac Marcel Proust wrote that “the only true voyage . . . would be not to visit strange lands but to-possess other eyes.”41 In the summer of 1996, I tried on a pair of new eyes when I took Paxil, a cousin of Prozac, for eight weeks. For the first few weeks I had only side effects: some nausea, difficulty sleeping through the night, and a variety of physical sensations that I did not know my body could produce, including a feeling I can describe only by saying that my brain felt dry. But then one day in week five, the world changed color. I woke up one morning and no longer felt anxious about the heavy work load arid uncertain prospects of an untenured professor. It was like magic. A set of changes I had wanted to make in myself for years— loosening up, lightening up, accepting my mistakes without dwelling on them—happened overnight. However, Paxil had one devastating side effect for me: It made it hard for me to recall facts and names, even those I knew",497
Page 55,"4 0 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s well. I would greet my students and colleagues, reach for a name to put af­ ter “Hi,” and be left with “Hi . . . there.” I decided that as a professor I needed my memory more than I needed peace of mind, so I stopped taking Paxil. Five weeks later, my memory came back, along with my worries. What remained was a firsthand experience of wearing rose-colored glasses, of seeing the world with new eyes. Prozac was the first member of a class of drugs known as selective sero­ tonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. In what follows, I use Prozac to stand for the whole group, the psychological effects of which are nearly identical, and which includes Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa, Lexapro, and others. Many things are not known about Prozac and its cousins—above all, how they work. The name of the drug class tells part of the story: Prozac gets into the synapses (the gaps between neurons), but it isselective in affecting only synapses that useserotonin as their neurotransmitter. Once in the synapses, Prozac inhibits the reuftake process—the normal process in which a neuron that has just released serotonin into the synapse then sucks it back up into itself, to be re­ leased again at the next neural pulse. The net result is that a brain on Prozac has more serotonin in certain synapses, so those neurons fire more often. So far Prozac sounds like cocaine, heroin, or any other drug that you might have learned is associated with a specific neurotransmitter. But the increase in serotonin happens within a day of taking Prozac, while the ben­ efits don't appear for four to six weeks. Somehow, the neuron on the other side of the synapse is adapting to the new level of serotonin, and it is from that adaptation process that the benefits probably emerge. Or maybe neu­ ral adaptation has nothing to do with it. The other leading theory about Prozac is that it raises the level of a neural growth hormone in the hip­ pocampus, a part of the brain crucial for learning and memory. People who have a negative affective style generally have higher levels of stress hor­ mones in their blood; these hormones, in turn, tend to kill off or prune back some critical cells in the hippocampus, whose job, in part, is to shut off the very stress response that is killing them. So people who have a neg­ ative affective style may often suffer minor neural damage to the hip­ pocampus, but this can be repaired in four or five weeks after Prozac triggers the release of the neural growth hormone.42Although we don’t",584
Page 56,"Changing YourMind 41 know haw Prozac works, we do know that it works: It produces benefits above placebo or no-treatment control groups on an astonishing variety of mental maladies, including depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic attacks, social phobia, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, some eating disor­ ders, and obsessive compulsive disorder.43 Prozac is controversial for at least two reasons. First, it is a shortcut. In most studies, Prozac turns out to be just about as effective as cognitive therapy— sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less—but its so much easier than therapy No daily homework or difficult new skills; no weekly therapy appointment. If you believe in the Protestant work ethic and the maxim “No pain, no gain,”then you might be disturbed by Prozac. Second, Prozac does more than just relieve symptoms; it sometimes changes per­ sonality. In Listening to Prozac,44Peter Kramer presents case studies of his patients whose long-standing depression or anxiety was cured by Prozac, and whose personalities then bloomed—greater self-confidence, greater resilience in the face of setbacks, and more joy, all of which sometimes led to big changes in careers and relationships. These cases conform to an ide­ alized medical narrative: person suffers from lifelong disease; medical breakthrough cures disease; person released from shackles, celebrates new freedom; closing shot of person playing joyously with children; fade to black. But Kramer also tells fascinating stories about people who were not ill, who met no diagnostic category for a mental disorder, and who just had the sorts of neuroses and personality quirks that most people have to some degree—fear of criticism, inability to be happy when not in a relationship, tendency to be too critical and overcontrolling of spouse and children. Like all personality traits, these are hard to change, but they are what talk ther­ apy is designed to address. Therapy cant usually change personality, but it can teach you ways of working around your problematic traits. Yet when Kramer prescribed Prozac, the offending traits went away Lifelong habits, gone overnight (five weeks after starting Prozac), whereas years of psy­ chotherapy often had done nothing. This is why Kramer coined the term “cosmetic psychopharmacology,”for Prozac seemed to promise that psychi­ atrists could shape and perfect minds just as plastic surgeons shape and perfect bodies.",498
Page 57,"42 T h e H a p p i n eHsy p o t h e s i s Does that sound like progress, or like Pandora sbox? Before you answer that, answer this: Which of these two phrases rings truest to you: “Be all that you can be”or “This above all, to thine own self be true.”Our culture endorses both—relentless self-improvement as well as authenticity—but we often escape the contradiction by framing self-improvement as authen­ ticity. Just as gaining an education means struggling for twelve to twenty years to develop one s intellectual potential, character development ought to involve a lifelong struggle to develop ones moral potential. A nine-year- old child does not stay true to herself by keeping the mind and character of a nine-year-old; she works hard to reach her ideal self, pushed and chauf- feured by her parents to endless after-school and weekend classes in piano, religion, art, and athletics. As long as change is gradual and a result of the child’s hard work, the child is given the moral credit for the change, and that change is in the service of authenticity. But what if there were a pill that enhanced tennis skills? Or a minor surgical technique for implanting piano virtuosity directly and permanently into the brain? Such a separation of self-improvement from authenticity would make many people recoil in horror. Horror fascinates me, particularly when there is no victim. I study moral reactions to harmless taboo violations such as consensual incest and pri­ vate flag desecration. These things just feel wrong to most people, even when they cant explain why. (IT1 explain why in chapter 9.) My research indicates that a small set of innate moral intuitions guide and constrain the worlds many moralities, and one of these intuitions is that the body is a temple housing a soul within.45 Even people who do not consciously be­ lieve in God or the soul are offended by or feel uncomfortable about some­ one who treats her body like a playground, its sole purpose to provide pleasure. A shy woman who gets a nose job, breast augmentation, twelve body piercings, and a prescription for elective Prozac would be as shocking to many people as a minister who remodels his church to look like an Otto­ man harem. The transformation of the church might hurt others by causing several parishioners to die from apoplexy. It is hard, however, to find harm in the self-transformer beyond some vague notion that she is “not being true to herself.” But if this woman had previously been unhappy with her hyper­",548
Page 58,"Changing Your Mind 43 sensitive and overly inhibited personality, and if she had made little progress with psychotherapy, why exactly should she be true to a self she doesn’t want? Why not change herself for the better? When I took Paxil, it changed my affective style for the better. It made me into something I was not, but had long wanted to be: a person who worries less, and who sees the world as being full of possibilities, not threats. Paxil improved the bal­ ance between my approach and withdrawal systems, and had there been no side effects, I would still be taking it today. I therefore question the widespread view that Prozac and other drugs in its class are overprescribed. Its easy for those who did well in the cortical lottery to preach about the importance of hard work and the unnaturalness of chemical shortcuts. But for those who, through no fault of their own, ended up on the negative half of the affective style spectrum, Prozac is a way to compensate for the unfairness of the cortical lottery. Furthermore, its easyfor those who believe that the body is a temple to say that cosmetic psychopharmacology is a kind of sacrilege. Something is indeed lost when psychiatrists no longer listen totheir patients as people, but rather as a car mechanic would listen to an engine, looking only for clues about which knob to adjust next. But if the hippocampal theory of Prozac is correct, many people really do need a mechanical adjustment. Its as though they had been driving for years with the emergency break halfway engaged, and it might be worth a five-weekexperiment to see what happens to their lives when the brake is released. Framed in this way, Prozac for the “worried well” is no longer just cosmetic. It is more like giving contact lenses to a person with poor but functional eyesight who has learned ways of coping with her limitations. Far from being a betrayal of that persons “true self,” contact lenses can be a reasonable shortcut to proper functioning. The epigraphs that opened this chapter are true. Life is what we deem it, and our lives are the creations of our minds. But these claims are not helpful until augmented by a theory of the divided self (such as the rider and the elephant) and an understanding of negativity bias and affective style. Once you know why change is so hard, you can drop the brute force method and take a more psychologically sophisticated approach to self- improvement. Buddha got it exactly right: You need a method for taming",520

It is the wedding day of the daughter of the God­ father, Don Corleone. The Italian immigrant Bonasera, an undertaker, has come to ask for a favor: He wants to avenge an assault upon the honor and body of his own daughter, who was beaten by her boyfriend and another young man. Bonasera describes the assault, the arrest, and the trial of the two boys. The judge gave them a suspended sentence and let them go free 45",340

Bonasera whispers something into his ear, which we can safely assume is “Kill them.” Corleone refuses, and points out that Bonasera has not been much of a friend until now. Bonasera admits he was afraid of getting into “trouble.”The dialogue continues:3 CORLEONE: I understand. You found paradise in America, you had a good trade, made a good living. The police protected you and there were courts of law. And you didn't need a friend like me. But now you come tome and you say, “Don Corleone givemejustice.”Butyou don't askwith respect.

Bonasera . . . What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? If you'd come to me in friend­ ship, then this scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day.

But until that day—accept thisjustice as a gift on my daughter's wedding day. The scene is extraordinary, a kind of overture that introduces the themes of violence, kinship, and morality that drive the rest of the movie.

U l t r a s o c i a l i t y Animals that fly seem to violate the laws of physics, but only until you learn a bit more about physics. Flight evolved independently at least three times in the animal kingdom: in insects, dinosaurs (including modern birds), and mammals (bats). In each case, a physical feature that had po­ tentially aerodynamic properties was already present (for example, scales that lengthened into feathers, which later made gliding possible). Animals that live in large peaceful societies seem to violate the laws of evolution (such as competition and survival of the fittest), but only until you learn a bit more about evolution. Ultrasociality4—living in large cooper­ ative societies in which hundreds or thousands of individuals reap the ben­ efits of an extensive division of labor—evolved independently at least four times in the animal kingdom: among hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps); termites; naked mole rats; and humans. In each case, a feature possessing potentially cooperation-enhancing properties already existed. For all the nonhuman ultrasocial species, that feature was the genetics of kin altruism. Its obvious that animals will risk their lives for the safety of their own chil­ dren: The only way to “win” at the game of evolution is to leave surviving copies of your genes. Yet not just your children carry copies of your genes. Your siblings arejust as closely related to you (50 percent shared genes) as your children; your nephews and nieces share a quarter of your genes, and your cousins one eighth. In a strictly Darwinian calculation, whatever cost",521
Page 63,"4 8 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s you would bear to save one of your children you should be willing to pay to save two nieces or four cousins.5 Because nearly all animals that live in cooperative groups live in groups of close relatives, most altruism in the animal kingdom reflects the simple axiom that shared genes equals shared interests. But because the sharing drops off so quickly with each fork in the family tree (second cousins share only one thirty-second of their genes), kin altruism explains only how groups of a few dozen, or perhaps a hundred, animals can work together. Out of a flock of thousands, only a small percentage would be close enough to be worth taking risks for. The rest would be competitors, in the Darwin­ ian sense. Here’swhere the ancestors of bees, termites, and mole rats took the common mechanism of kin altruism, which makes many species socia­ ble, and parlayed it6into the foundation of their uncommon ultrasociality: They are all siblings. Those species each evolved a reproduction system in which a single queen produces all the children, and nearly all the children are either sterile (ants) or else their reproductive abilities are suppressed (bees, mole rats); therefore, a hive, nest, or colony of these animals is one big family. If everyone around you is your sibling, and if the survival of your genes depends on the survival of your queen, selfishness becomes genetic suicide. These ultrasocial species display levels of cooperation and self- sacrifice that still astonish and inspire those who study them. Some ants, for example, spend their lives hanging from the top of a tunnel, offering their abdomens for use as food storage bags ^bythe rest of the nest.7 The ultrasocial animals evolved into a state of ultrakinship, which led automatically to ultracooperation (as in building and defending a large nest or hive), which allowed the massive division of labor (ants have castes such as soldier, forager, nursery worker, and food storage bag), which created hives overflowing with milk and honey, or whatever other substance they use to store their surplus food. We humans also try to extend the reach of kin altruism by using fictitious kinship names for nonrelatives, as when children are encouraged to call their parents’friends Uncle Bob and Aunt Sarah. Indeed, the mafia is known as “the family,” and the very idea of a godfather is an attempt to forge a kin-like link with a man who is not true kin. The human mind finds kinship deeply appealing, and kin altruism surely underlies the cultural ubiquity of nepotism. But even in the mafia,",564
Page 64,"Reciprocity with a Vengeance 49 kin altruism can take you only so far. At some point you have to work with people who are at best distant relations, and to do so youd better have an­ other trick up your sleeve. Y o u S c r a t c h M y B a c k, I l l S c r a t c h Yo u r s What would you do if you received a Christmas card from a complete stranger? This actually happened in a study in which a psychologist sent Christmas cards to people at random. The great majority sent him a card in return.8In his insightful book Influence,9Robert Cialdinj of Arizona State University cites this and other studies as evidence that people have a mindless, automatic reciprocity reflex. Like other animals, we will perform certain behaviors when the world presents us with certain patterns of in­ put. A baby herring gull, seeing a red spot on its mothers beak, pecks at it automatically, and out comes regurgitated food. The baby gull will peck just asvigorously at a red spot painted on the end of a pencil. A cat stalks a mouse using the same low-down, wiggle-close-then-pounce technique used by cats around the world. The cat uses the same technique to attack a string trailing a ball of yarn because the string accidentally activates the catsmouse-tail-detector module. Cialdini sees human reciprocity as a sim­ ilar ethological reflex: a person receives a favor from an acquaintance and wants to repay the favor. The person will even repay an empty favor from a stranger, such as the receipt of a worthless Christmas card. The animal and human examples are not exactly parallel, however. The gulls and cats are responding to visual stimuli with specific bodily move­ ments, executed immediately. The person is responding to the meaning of a situation with a motivation that can be satisfied by a variety of bodily movements executed days later So what is really built into the person is a strategy: Play tit for tat. Do to others what they do unto you. Specifically, the tit-for-tat strategy is to be nice on the first round of interaction; but af­ ter that, do to your partner whatever your partner did to you on the previ­ ous round.10Tit for tat takes us way beyond kin altruism. It opens the possibility of forming cooperative relationships with strangers.",505
Page 65,"50 T h e H a p p i n e Hy p o t h e s i s Most interactions among animals (other than close kin) are zero-sum games: One animals gain is the others loss. But life is full of situations in which cooperation would expand the pie to be shared if only a way could be found to cooperate without being exploited. Animals that hunt are par­ ticularly vulnerable to the variability of success: They may find far more food than they can eat in one day, and then find no food at all for three weeks. Animals that can trade their surplus on a day of plenty for a loan on a day of need are much more likely to survive the vagaries of chance. Vam­ pire bats, for example, will regurgitate blood from a successful night of bloodsucking into the mouth of an unsuccessful and genetically unrelated peer. Such behavior seems to violate the spirit of Darwinian competition, except that the bats keep track of who has helped them in the past, and in return they share primarily with those bats.11Like the Godfather, bats play tit for tat, and so do other social animals, particularly those that live in rel­ atively small, stable groups where individuals can recognize each other as individuals.12 But if the response to noncooperation isjust noncooperation on the next round, then tit for tat can unite groups of only a few hundred. In a large enough group, a cheating vampire bat can beg a meal from a different suc­ cessful bat each night and, when they come to him pleading for a return fa­ vor, just'wrap his wings around his head and pretend to be asleep. What are they going to do to him? Well, if these were people rather than hats, we know what they'd do: They'd beat the hell out of him. Vengeance and grat­ itude are moral sentiments that amplify and enforce tit for tat. Vengeful and grateful feelings appear to have evolved precisely because they are such useful tools for helping individuals create cooperative relationships, thereby reaping the gains from non-zero-sum games.13A species equipped with vengeance and gratitude responses can support larger and more coop­ erative social groups because the payoff to cheaters is reduced by the costs they bear in making enemies.14Conversely, the benefits of generosity are increased because one gains friends. Tit for tat appears to be built into human nature as a set of moral emo­ tions that make us want to return favor for favor, insult for insult, tooth for tooth, and eye for eye. Several recent theorists15 even talk about an “ex­",538
Page 66,"Reciprocity with a Vengeance 51 change organ” in the human brain, as though a part of the brain were devoted to keeping track of fairness, debts owed, and social accounts- receivable. The “organ” is a metaphor—nobody expects to find an isolated blob of brain tissue the only function of which is to enforce reciprocity. However, recent evidence suggests that there really could be an exchange organ in the brain if we loosen the meaning of “organ”and allow that func­ tional systems in the brain are often composed of widely separated bits of neural tissue that work:together to do a specific job. Suppose you were invited to play the “ultimatum” game, which econo­ mists invented16to study the tension between fairness and greed. It goes like this: Two people come to the lab but never meet. The experimenter gives one of them—lets suppose its not you—twenty one-dollar bills and asks her to divide them between the two of you in any way she likes. She then gives you an ultimatum: Take it or leave it. The catch is that if you leave it, if you say no, you both get nothing. If you were both perfectly ra­ tional, as most economists would predict, your partner would offer you one dollar, knowing that you’d prefer one dollar to no dollars, and you’d accept her offer, because she was right about you. But the economists were wrong about you both. In real life, nobody offers one dollar, and around half of all people offer ten dollars. But what would you do if your partner offered you seven dollars? Or five? Or three? Most people would accept the seven dol­ lars, but not the three. Most people are willing to pay a few dollars, but not seven, to punish the selfish partner. Now suppose you played this game while inside an fMRI scanner. Alan Sanfey17and his colleagues at Princeton had people do just that; the re­ searchers then looked at what parts of the brain were more active when people were given unfair offers. One of the three areas that differed most (when comparing responses to unfair vs. fair offers) was the frontal insula, an area of the cortex on the frontal underside of the brain. The frontal in­ sula is known to be active during most negative or unpleasant emotional states, particularly anger and disgust. Another area was the dorsolateral pre- frontal cortex, just behind the sides of the forehead, known to be active during reasoning and calculation. Perhaps the most impressive finding from Sanfey’s study is that people’s ultimate response—accept or reject—could",547
Page 67,"52 T h e H a p p i n eHsy p o t h e s i s be predicted by looking at the state of their brains moments before they pressed a button to make a choice. Those subjects who showed more acti­ vation in the insula than in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex generally went on to reject the unfair offer; those with the reverse pattern generally ac­ cepted it. (Its no wonder that marketers, political consultants, and the CIA are sointerested in neural imaging and “neuromarketing.'') Gratitude and vengefulness are big steps on the road that led to human ultrasociality, and its important to realize that they are two sides of one coin. It would be hard to evolve one without the other. An individual who had gratitude without vengefulness would be an easy mark for exploitation, and a vengeful and ungrateful individual would quickly alienate all poten­ tial cooperative partners. Gratitude and revenge are also, not coinciden­ tally, major forces holding together the mafia. The Godfather sits at the center of a vast web of reciprocal obligations and favors. He accumulates power with each favor he does, secure in the knowledge that nobody who values his own life will fail to repay at a time of the Godfathers choosing. Revenge for most of us is much less drastic, but if you have worked long enough in an office, restaurant, or store, you know there are many subtle ways to retaliate against those who have crossed you, and many ways to help those who have helped you. Y o u S t a b H i s B a c k, I 'l l S t a b Y o u r s When I said that people would beat the hell out of an ingrate who failed to repay an important favor, I left out aqualification. For a first offense, they'd probably just gossip. They'd ruin his reputation. Gossip is another key piece in the puzzle of how humans became ultrasocial. It might also be the reason we have such large heads. WoodyAllen once described hisbrain as his “second favorite organ,"" but for all of us it's by far the most expensive one to run. It accounts for 2 per­ cent of our body weight but consumes 20 percent of our energy. Human brains grow so large that human beings must be born prematurely18 (at least, compared to other mammals, who are born when their brains are more or less ready to control their bodies), and even then they can barely",528
Page 68,"Reciprocity with a Vengeance 53 make it through the birth canal. Once out of the womb, these giant brains attached to helpless baby bodies require somebody to carry them around for a year or two. The tripling of human brain size from the time of our last common ancestor with chimpanzees to today imposed tremendous costs on parents, so there must have been a verygood reason to do it. Some have argued that the reason was hunting and tool making, others suggest that the extra gray matter helped our ancestors locate fruit. But the only theory that explains why animals in general have particular brain sizes is the one that maps brain size onto social group size. Robin Dunbar19 has demon­ strated that within a given group of vertebrate species—primates, carni­ vores, ungulates, birds, reptiles, or fish-—the logarithm of the brain size is almost perfectly proportional to the logarithm of the social group size. In otherwords, all over the animal kingdom, brains grow to manage larger and larger groups. Social animals are smart animals. Dunbar points out that chimpanzees live in groups of around thirty, and like all social primates, they spend enormous amounts of time grooming each other. Human beings ought to live in groups of around 150 people, judging from the logarithm of our brain size; and sure enough, studies of hunter-gatherer groups, military units, and city dwellers’ address books suggest that 100 to 150 is the “natural”group size within which people can know just about everyone directly, by name and face, and know how each person is related to everybody else. But if grooming is so central to primate sociality, and if our ancestors began living in larger and larger groups (for some other reason, such as to take advantage of a new ecological niche with high predation risks), at some point grooming became an inadequate means of keeping up ones relationships. Dunbar suggests that language evolved as a replacement for physical grooming.20Language allows small groups of people to bond quickly and to learn from each other about the bonds of others. Dunbar notes that people do in fact use language primarily to talk about other people— to find out who is doing what to whom, who is coupling with whom, who is fighting with whom. And Dunbar points out that in our ultrasocial species, success is largelya matter of playing the social game well. Its not what you know, its who you know. In short, Dunbar proposes that language evolved because it enabled gossip. Individuals who could share social information, using any",532
Page 69,"54 T h e H a p p i n eHsy p o t h e s i s primitive means of communication, had an advantage over those who could not. And once people began gossiping, there was a runaway competition to master-the arts of social manipulation, relationship aggression, anii reputa­ tion management, all of which require yet more brain power. Nobody knows how language evolved, but I find Dunbars speculation so fascinating that I love to tell people about it. Its not good gossip—after all, you don’t know Dunbar—but if you are like me you have an urge to tell your friends about anything you learn that amazes or fascinates you, and this urge itselfillustrates Dunbars point: We are motivated to pass on infor­ mation to our friends; we even sometimes say, “I cant keep it in, I have to tell somebody”And when you do pass on a piece ofjuicy gossip, what hap­ pens? Your friends reciprocity reflex kicks in and she feels a slight pressure to return the favor. If she knows something about the person or event in question, she is likely to speak up: “Oh really? Well, I heard that he . . Gossip elicits gossip, and it enables us to keep track of everyones reputa­ tion without having to witness their good and bad deeds personally. Gossip creates a non-zero-sum game because it costs us nothing to give each other information, yet we both benefit by receiving information. Because I’m particularly interested in the role of gossip in our moral lives, I was pleased when a graduate student in my department, Holly Horn, told me that she wanted to study gossip. In one of Hollys studies,?1 we asked fifty-one people to fill out a short questionnaire each time over the course of a week that they took part in a conversation that went on for at least ten minutes. We then took only the records in which the topic of conversation was another person, which gave us about one episode of po­ tential gossip per day per person. Among our main findings: Gossip is over­ whelmingly critical, and it is primarily about the moral and social violations of others. (For college students, this meant a lot of talk about the sexuality, cleanliness, and drinking habits of their friends and roommates.) People do occasionally tell stories about the good deeds of others, but such stories are only one tenth as common as stories about transgressions. When people pass along high-quality (“juicy”) gossip, they feel more powerful, they have a better shared sense of what is right and what’swrong, and they feel more closely connected to their gossip partners.",553
Page 70,"Reciprocitywith a Vengeance 55 A second study revealed that most people hold negative views of gossip and gossipers, even though almost everyone gossips. When we compared peoples attitudes about gossip to the social functions that gossip serves, Holly and I came to believe that gossip is underappreciated. In a world with no gossip, people would not get away with murder but they would get away with a trail of rude, selfish, and antisocial acts, often oblivious to their own violations. Gossip extends our moral-emotional toolkit. In a gos­ sipy world, we don't just feel vengeance and gratitude toward those who hurt or help us; we feel pale but still instructive flashes of contempt and anger toward people whom we might not even know. We feel vicarious shame and embarrassment when we hear about people whose schemes, lusts, and private failings are exposed. Gossip is a policeman and a teacher. Without it, there would be chaos and ignorance.22 Many species reciprocate, but only humans gossip, and much of what we gossip about is the value of other people as partners for reciprocal rela­ tionships. Using these tools, we create an ultrasocial world, a world in which we refrain from nearly all the ways we could take advantage of those weaker than us, a world in which we often help those who are unlikely ever to be able to return the favor. We want to play tit for tat, which means starting out nice without being a pushover, and we want to cultivate a rep­ utation for being a good player. Gossip and reputation make sure that what goes around comes around—a person who is cruel will find that others are cruel back to him, and a person who is kind will find that other others are kind in return. Gossip paired with reciprocity allow karma to work here on earth, not in the next life. As long as everyone plays tit-for-tat augmented by gratitude, vengeance, and gossip, the whole system should work beauti­ fully. (It rarely does, however, because of our self-serving biases and mas- sive hypocrisy. See chapter 4.) U s e t h e F o r c e, L u k e In offering reciprocity as the best word to guide ones life, Confucius was wise. Reciprocity is like a magic wand that can clear your way through the",494
Page 71,"56 T h e H a p p i n eHsy p o t h e s i s jungle of social life. But as anyone who has read a Harry Potter book knows, magic wands can be used against you. Robert Cialdini spent years studying the dark arts of social influence: He routinely answered ads re­ cruiting people to work as door-to-door salesmen and telemarketers, and went through their training programs to learn their techniques. He then wrote a manual23for those of us who want to resist the tricks of “compli­ ance professionals.” Cialdini describes sixprinciples that salespeople use against us, but the most basjc of all is reciprocity. People who want something from us try to give us something first, and we all have piles of address stickers and free postcards from charities that gave them to us out of the goodness of their marketing consultants' hearts. The Hare Krishnas perfected the technique: They pressed flowers or cheap copies of the Bhagavad Gita into the hands of unsuspecting pedestrians, and only then asked for a donation. When Cialdini studied the Krishnas at O'Hare Airport in Chicago, he noticed that they routinely went around the garbage pails to collect and recycle the flowers that they knew would be thrown away. Few people wanted the flowers, but in the early days of the technique, most were unable just to ac­ cept them and walk on without giving something in return. The Krishnas grew wealthy by exploiting peoples reciprocity reflexes—until everyone learned about the Krishnas and found ways to avoid taking the “gift”in the first place. But legions of others are still after you. Supermarkets and Amway deal­ ers give out free samples to boost sales. Waiters and waitresses put a mint on the check tray, a technique that has been shown to boost tips 24Includ­ ing a five-dollar “gift check” along with a survey sent in the mail increases peoples willingness to complete the survey, even more than does promis­ ing to send them fifty dollars for completing the survey.25If you get some­ thing for nothing, part of you may be pleased, but part of you (part of the elephant—automatic processes) moves your hand to your wallet to give something back. Reciprocity works just as well for bargaining. Cialdini was once asked by a boy scout to buy tickets to a movie he didn't want to see. When Cialdini said no, the scout asked him to buy some less expensive chocolate bars in­ stead. Cialdini found himself walking away with three chocolate bars that",551
Page 72,"Reciprocity with a Vengeance 57 he didn't want. The scout had made a concession, and Cialdini automati­ cally reciprocated by making a concession of his own. But rather than get­ ting mad, Cialdini got data. He conducted his own version of the encounter, asking college students walking on campus whether they would volunteer to chaperone a group ofjuvenile delinquents to the zoo for a day. Only 17 per­ cent agreed. But in another condition of the study, students were first asked whether they would volunteer to work for two hours a week for two years with juvenile delinquents. All said no, but when the experimenter then asked about the day trip to the zoo, 50 percent said yes.26Concession leads to concession. In financial bargaining, too, people who stake out an extreme first position and then move toward the middle end up doing better than those who state a more reasonable first position and then hold fast.27And the extreme offer followed by concession doesn't just get you a better price, it gets you a happier partner (or victim): She is more likely to honor the agreement because she feels that she had more influence on the outcome. The very process of give and take creates a feeling of partnership, even in the person being taken. So the next time a salesman gives you a free gift or consultation, or makes a concession of any sort, duck Don't let him press your reciprocity button. The best way out, Cialdini advises, is to fight reciprocity with reci­ procity. If you can reappraise the salesman's move for what it is—an effort to exploit you—you'll feel entitled to exploit him right back. Accept the gift or concession with a feeling of victory—you are exploiting an exploiter— not mindless obligation. Reciprocity is not just a way of dealing with boy scouts and obnoxious salespeople; it's for friends and lovers, too. Relationships are exquisitely sensitive to balance in their early stages, and a great way to ruin things is either to give too much (you seem perhaps a bit desperate) or too little (you seem cold and rejecting). Rather, relationships grow best by balanced give and take, especially of gifts, favors, attention, and self-disclosure. The first three are somewhat obvious, but people often don't realize the degree to which the disclosure of personal information is a gambit in the dating game. When someone tells you about past romantic relationships, there is conversational pressure for you to do the same. If this disclosure card is played too early, you might feel ambivalence—your reciprocity reflex makes",553

But when its played at the right time, the past-relationships-mutual-disclosure conversation can be a memorable turning point on the road to love. Reciprocity is an all-purpose relationship tonic. Used properly, it strength­ ens, lengthens, and rejuvenates social ties. It works so well in part because the elephant is a natural mimic. For example, when we interact with some­ one we like, we have a slight tendency to copy their every move, automati­ cally and unconsciously.28 If the other person taps her foot, you are more likely to tap yours. If she touches her face, you are more likely to touch yours. But its notjust that we mimic those we like; we like those who mimic us. People who are subtly mimicked are then more helpful and agreeable to­ ward their mimicker, and even toward others.29Waitresses who mimic their customers get larger tips.30 Mimicry is a kind of social glue, a way of saying “We are one.”The uni­ fying pleasures of mimicry are particularly clear in synchronized activities, such as line dances, group cheers, and some religious rituals, in which people try to do the same thing at the same time. A theme of the rest of this book is that humans are partially hive creatures, like bees, yet in the modern world we spend nearly all our time outside of the hive. Reciprocity, like love, reconnects us with others.",352

Speaking of the horrors of such coservice, he said, “I mean, they are in the showers with you, they are in the dining hall with you.”2In August 2004, audio tapes were made public of the messages that Schrock, a married man, had left on Megamates, an interactive phone sex line. Schrock described the anatomical features of the kind of man he was seeking, along with the acts he was interested in performing. There is a special pleasure in the irony of a moralist brought down for the very moral failings he has condemned. Its the pleasure of a well-told joke. Some jokes are funny as one-liners, but most require three verses: three guys, say, who walk into a bar one at a time, or a priest, a minister, and a rabbi in a lifeboat. The first two set the pattern, and the third violates it. With hypocrisy, the hypocrites preaching is the setup, the hypocritical ac­ tion is the punch line. Scandal is great entertainment because it allows people to feel contempt, a moral emotion that gives feelings of moral superi­ ority while asking nothing in return. With contempt you don't need to right the wrong (aswith anger) or flee the scene (as with fear or disgust). And best of all, contempt is made to share. Stories about the moral failings of others are among the most common kinds of gossip,3they are a staple of talk radio, and they offer a readyway for people to show that they share a common moral orientation. Tell an acquaintance a cynical story that ends with both of you smirking and shakingyour heads and voila, youve got a bond. Well, stop smirking. One of the most universal pieces of advice from across cultures and eras is that we are all hypocrites, and in our condemna­ tion of others' hypocrisy we only compound our own. Social psychologists have recently isolated the mechanisms that make us blind to the logs in our own eyes. The moral implications of these findings are disturbing; in­ deed, they challenge our greatest moral certainties. But the implications can be liberating, too, freeing you from destructive moralism and divisive self-righteousness. K e e p i n g U p A p p e a r a n c e s Research on the evolution of altruism and cooperation has relied heavily on studies in which several people (or people simulated on a computer)",538
Page 76,"The Faults of Others 61 play a game. On each round of play, one person interacts with one other player and can choose to be cooperative (thereby expanding the pie they then share) or greedy (each grabbing as much as possible for himself). Af­ ter many rounds ofplay, you count up the number of points each player ac­ cumulated and see which strategy was most profitable in the long run. In these games, which are intended to be simple models of the game of life, no strategy ever beats tit for tat.4In the long run and across a variety of en­ vironments, it pays to cooperate while remaining vigilant to the danger of being cheated. But those simple games are in some ways simple minded. Players face a binary choice at each point: They can cooperate or defect. Each player then reacts to what the other player did in the previous round. In real life, however, you dont react to what someone did; you react only to what you think she did, and the gap between action and perception is bridged by the art of impression management. If life itself is but what you deem it, then why not focus your efforts on persuading others to believe that you are a virtuous and trustworthy cooperator? Thus Niccolo Machia- velli, whose name has become synonymous with the cunning and amoral use of power, wrote five hundred years ago that “the great majority of mankind are satisfied with appearances, as though they were realities, and are often more influenced by the things that seem than by those that are.”5 Natural selection, like politics, works by the principle of survival of the fittest, and several researchers have argued that human beings evolved to play the game of life in a Machiavellian way.6The Machiavellian version of tit for tat, for example, is to do all you can to cultivate the refutation of a trustworthy yet vigilant partner, whatever the reality may be. The simplest way to cultivate a reputation for being fair is to really be fair, but life and psychology experiments sometimes force us to choose between appearance and reality. Dan Batson at the University of Kansas devised a clever way to make people choose, and his findings are not pretty. He brought students into his lab one at a time to take part in what they thought was a study of how unequal rewards affect teamwork.7The proce­ dure was explained: One member of each team of two will be rewarded for correct responses to questions with a raffle ticket that could win a valuable prize. The other member will receive nothing. Subjects were also told that an additional part of the experiment concerned the effects of control: You,",549
Page 77,"62 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s the subject, will decide which of you is rewarded, which of you is not. Your partner is already here, in another room, and the two of you will not meet. Your partner will be told that the decision was made by chance. You can make the decision in any wayyou like. Oh, and here is a coin: Most people in this study seem to think that flipping the coin is the fairest way to make the decision. Subjects were then left alone to choose. About half of them used the coin. Batson knows this because the coin was wrapped in a plastic bag, and half the bags were ripped open. Of those who did not flip the coin, 90 percent chose the positive task for themselves. For those who did flip the coin, the laws of probability were suspended and 90 percent of them chose the posi­ tive task for themselves. Batson had given all the subjects a variety of ques­ tionnaires about morality weeks earlier (the subjects were students in psychology classes), so he was able to check how various measures of moral personality predicted behavior. His finding: People who reported being most concerned about caring for others and about issues of social responsibility were more likely to open the bag, but they were not more likely to give the otherperson the positive task. In other words, people who think they arepar­ ticularlymoral are in fact more likely to “do the right thing”and flip the coin, but when the coin flip comes out against them, they find a way to ignore it and follow their own self-interest. Batson called this tendency to value the appearance of morality over the reality “moral hypocrisy.” Batsons subjects who flipped the coin reported (on a questionnaire) that they had made the decision in an ethical way. After his first study, Batson wondered whether perhaps people tricked themselves by not stating clearly what heads or tails would mean (“Lets see, heads, that means, um, oh yeah, I get the good one.”). But when he labeled the two sides of the coin to erase ambiguity, it made no difference. Placing a large mirror in the room, right in front of the subject, and at the same time stressing the importance offairness in the instructions, was the only manipulation that had an effect. When people were forced to think about fairness and could see themselves cheat­ ing, theystopped doing it. AsJesus and Bujddha said in the opening epigraphs of this chapter, it is easyto spot a cheater when our eyes are looking outward, but hard when looking inward. Folkwisdom from around the world concurs:",560
Page 78,"The Faults ofOthers 63 Though you see the seven defects of others, we do not see our own ten defects. (Japanese proverb)8 A he-goat doesn't realize that he smells. (Nigerian proverb)9 Proving that people are selfish, or that they1 sometimes cheat when they know they won't be caught, seems like a good way to get an article into the Journal ofIncredibly Obvious Results. What's not so obvious is that, in nearly all these studies, people don't think they are doing anything wrong. It's the same in real life. From the person who cuts you offon the highwayall the way to the Nazis who ran the concentration camps, most people think they are good people and that their actions are motivated by good reasons. Machiavel­ lian tit for tat requires devotion to appearances, including protestations of one's virtue even when one chooses vice. And such protestations are most ef­ fective when the person making them reallybelieves them. As Robert Wright put it in his masterful book The MoralAnimal, “Human beings are a species splendid in their array of moral equipment, tragic in their propensity to mis­ use it, and pathetic in their constitutional ignorance of the misuse.''10 If Wright is correct about our “constitutional ignorance'' of our hypocrisy, then the sages' admonition to stop smirking may be no more effective than telling a depressedperson to snap out ofit. You can't change your mental fil­ ters by willpower alone; you have to engage in activities such as meditation or cognitive therapy that train the elephant. But at least a depressed person will usually admit she's depressed. Curing hypocrisy is much harder be­ cause part of the problem is that we don't believe there's a problem. We are well-armedfor battle in a Machiavellian world of reputation manipulation, and one of our most important weapons is the delusion that we are non- combatants. How do we get away with it?

Page 79,"64 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s and then made up reasons, sometimes bad ones, to justify their condemna­ tion. In my studies of moraljudgment, I have found that people are skilled at finding reasons to support their gut feelings: The rider acts like a lawyer whom the elephant has hired to represent it in the court of public opinion. One of the reasons people are often contemptuous of lawyers is that they fight for a clients interests, not for the truth. To be a good lawyer, it often helps to be a good liar. Although many lawyers won't tell a direct lie, most will do what they can to hide inconvenient facts while weaving a plausible alternative story for the judge and jury, a story that they some­ times know is not true. Our inner lawyer works in the same way, but, somehow, we actually believe the stories he makes up. To understand his ways we must catch him in action; we must observe him carrying out low- pressure as well as high-pressure assignments. People sometimes call their lawyers to ask whether a particular course of action is permissible. No pressure, just tell me whether I can do this. The lawyer looks into the relevant laws and procedures and calls back with aver­ dict: Yes, there is a legal or regulatory precedent for that; or perhaps no, as your lawyer I would advise against such a course. A good lawyer might look at all sides of a question, think about all possible, ramifications, and recom­ mend alternative courses of action, but such thoroughness depends in part on his client—does she really want advice or does shejust want to be given a red or a green light for her plan? Studies of everyday reasoning show that the elephant is not an inquisitive client. When people are given difficult questions to think about—for ex­ ample, whether the minimum wage should be raised—they generally lean one way or the other right away, and then put a call in to reasoning to see whether support for that position is forthcoming. For example, a person whose first instinct is that the minimum wage should be raised looks around for supporting evidence. If she thinks of her Aunt Flo who is working for the minimum wage and can't support her family on it then yes, that means the minimum wage should be raised. All done. Deanna Kuhn,11a cognitive psychologist who has studied such everyday reasoning, found that most people readily offered ‘pseudoevidence"" like the anecdote about Aunt Flo. Most people gave no real evidence for their positions, and most made no ef­ fort to look for evidence opposing their initial positions. David Perkins,12a",547
Page 80,"The Faults ofOthers 65 Harvard psychologist who has devoted his career to improving reasoning, found-the same thing. He says that thinking generally uses the “makes- sense” stopping rule. We take a position, look for evidence that supports it, and if we find some evidence—enough so that our position “makes sense”— we stop thinking. But at least in a low-pressure situation such as this, if someone else brings up reasons and evidence on the other side, people can be induced to change their minds; theyjust don't make an effort to do such thinking for themselves. Now lets crank up the pressure. The client has been caught cheating on her taxes. She calls her lawyer. She doesn't confess and ask, “Was that OK?'' She says, “Do something.'' The lawyer bolts into action, assesses the damaging evidence, researches precedents and loopholes, and figures out how some personal expenses might be plausibly justified as business ex­ penses. The lawyer has been given an order: Use all your powers to defend me. Studies of “motivated reasoning''13 show that people who are moti­ vated to reach a particular conclusion are even worse reasoners than those in Kuhn's and Perkins's studies, but the mechanism is basically the same: a one-sided search for supporting evidence only. People who are told that they have performed poorly on a test of social intelligence think extra hard to find reasons to discount the test; people who are asked to read a study showing that one of their habits—such as drinking coffee—-Is unhealthy think extra hard to find flaws in the study, flaws that people who don't drink coffee don't notice. Over and over again, studies show that people set out on a cognitive mission to bring back reasons to support their preferred belief or action. And because we are usually successful in this mission, we end up with the illusion of objectivity. We really believe that our position is rationally and objectivelyjustified. Ben Franklin, as usual, was wise to our tricks. But he showed unusual insight in catching himself in the act. Though he had been a vegetarian on principle, on one long sea crossing the men were grilling fish, and his mouth started watering: I balanc'd some time between principle and inclination, till I recollectd that, when the fish were opened, I saw smaller fish taken out of their stomachs; then thought I, “if you eat one another, I don't see why we",512
Page 81,"66 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s mayn't eat you/’ So I din'd upon cod very heartily, and continued to eat with other people, returning only now and then occasionally to a veg­ etable diet.14 Franklin concluded: “So convenient a thing is it to be a reasonable crea­ ture, since it enables one to find or make a reason for every thing one has a mind to do.'' T h e R o s e- C o l o r e d M i r r o r I don't want to blame everything on the lawyer. The lawyer is, after all, the rider—your conscious, reasoning self; and he is taking orders from the elephant—your automatic and unconscious self. The two are in cahoots to win at the game of life by playing Machiavellian tit for tat, and both are in denial about it. To win at this game you must present your best possible self to others. You must appear virtuous, whether or not you are, and you must gain the benefits of cooperation whether or not you deserve them. But everyone else is playing the same game, so you must also play defense—you must be wary of others' self-presentations, and of their efforts to claim more for themselves than they deserve. Social life is therefore always a game of so­ cial comparison. We must compare ourselves to other people, and our ac­ tions to their actions, and we must somehow spin those comparisons in our favor. (In depression, part of the illness is that spin goes the other way, as described byAaron Beck's cognitive triad: I'm bad, the world is terrible, and my future is bleak.) You can spin a comparison either by inflating your own claims or by disparaging the claims of others. You might expect, given what I've said sofar, that we do both, but the consistent finding of psycho­ logical research is that we are fairly accurate in our perceptions of others. It's our self-perceptions that are distorted because we look at ourselves in a rose-colored mirror. In Garrison Keillor's mythical town of Lake Wobegon, all the women are strong, all the men good looking, and all the children above average. But if the Wobegonians were real people, they would go further: Most of them",499
Page 82,"The Faults of Others 67 would believe they were stronger, better looking, or smarter than the aver­ age Wobegonian. When Americans and Europeans are asked to rate them­ selves on virtues, skills, or other desirable traits (including intelligence, driving ability, sexual skills, and ethics), a large majority say they are above average.15(This effect is weaker in EastAsian countries, and may not exist in Japan.)16 In a brilliant series of experiments,17Nick Epley and David Dunning fig­ ured out how we do it. Theyasked students at Cornell University to predict how many flowers they would buy in an upcoming charity event and how many the average Cornell student would buy. Then they looked at actual behavior. People had greatly overestimated their own virtue, but were pretty close on their guesses about others. In a second study, Epley and Dunning asked people to predict what they would do in a game that could be played for money either selfishly or cooperatively. Same findings: Eighty-four per­ cent predicted that they'd cooperate, but the subjects expected (on average) that only 64 percent of others would cooperate. When they ran the real game, 61 percent cooperated. In a third study, Epley and Dunning paid people five dollars for participating in an experiment and then asked them to predict how much of the money they and others would donate, hypothet­ ically, had they been given a particular charitable appeal after the study. People said (on average) they'd donate $2.44, and others would donate only $1.83. But when the study was rerun with a real request to give money, the average gift was $1.53. In their cleverest study, the researchers described the details of the third study to anew group of subjects and asked them topredict how much money they would donate if they had been in the “real” condition, and how much money other-Comell students would donate. Once again, subjects predicted they'd be much more generous than others. But then subjects saw the actual amounts of money donated by real subjects from the third study, revealed to them one at a time (and averaging $1.53). After beinggiven this new informa­ tion, subjects were given a chance to revise their estimates, and they did. They lowered their estimates of what others would give, but they did not change their estimates of what they themselves would give. In other words, subjects used base rate information properly to revise their predictions of oth­ ers, but theyrefused to applyit to their rosyself-assessments. Wejudge others",546
Page 83,"68 T h e Ha p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s by theirbehavior, but we think we have special information about ourselves— we know what we are“really like”inside, sowe can easily find ways to explain away our selfish acts and cling to the illusion that we are better than others. Ambiguity abets the illusion. For many traits, such as leadership, there are so many ways to define it that one is free to pick the criterion that will most flatter oneself. If I’m confident, I can define leadership as confi­ dence. If I think Fm high on people skills, I can define leadership as the ability to understand and influence people. When comparing ourselves to others, the general process is this: Frame the question (unconsciously, au­ tomatically) so that the trait in question is related to a self-perceived strength, then go out and look for evidence that you have the strength. Once you find a piece of evidence, once you have a “makes-sense” story, you are done. You can stop thinking, and revel in your self-esteem. Its no wonder, then, that in a study of 1 million American high school students, 70 percent thought they were above average on leadership ability, but only 2 percent thought they were below average. Everyone can find some skill that might be construed as related to leadership, and then find some piece of evidence that one has that skill.18(College professors are less wise than high school students in this respect—94 percent of us think we do above- average work.)19But when there is little room for ambiguity—how tall are you? how good are you atjuggling?—people tend to be much more modest. If the only effect of these rampant esteem-inflating biases was to make people feel good about themselves, they would not be a problem. In fact, evidence shows that people who hold pervasive positive illusions about themselves, their abilities, and their future prospects are mentally health­ ier, happier, and better liked than people who lack such illusions.20 But such biases can make people feel that they deserve more than they do, thereby setting the stage for endless disputes with other people who feel equally over-entitled. I fought endlessly with my first-year college roommates. I had provided much of our furniture, including the highly valued refrigerator, and I did most of the work keeping our common space clean. After a while, I got tired of doing more than my share; I stopped working so hard and let the space become messy so that someone else would pick up the slack. No­ body did. But they did pick up my resentment, and it united them in their",563
Page 84,"The Faults of Others 69 dislike of me. The next year, when we no longer lived together, we became close friends. When my father drove me and rny refrigerator up to college that first year, he told me that the most important things I was going to learn I would not learn in the classroom, and he was right. It took many more years of liv­ ing with roommates, but I finally realized what a fool I had made of myself that first year. Of course I thought I did more than my share. Although I was aware of every little thing I did for the group, I was aware of only a portion of everyone else’s contributions. And even if I had been correct in my ac­ counting, I was self-righteous in setting up the accounting categories. I picked the things I cared about—such as keeping the refrigerator clean— and then gave myself an A-plus in that category. As with other kinds of so­ cial comparison, ambiguity allows us to set up the comparison in ways that favor ourselves, and then to seek evidence that shows we are excellent co- operators. Studies of such “unconscious overclaiming”show that when hus­ bands and wives estimate the percentage of housework each does, their estimates total more than 120 percent.21 When MBA students in a work group make estimates of their contributions to the team, the estimates total 139 percent.22Whenever people form cooperative groups, which are usu­ ally of mutual benefit, self-serving biases threaten to fill group members with mutual resentment. I m R i g h ; Y o u 'r e B i a s e d If spouses, colleagues, and roommates so easily descend into resentment, things get worse when people who lack affection or shared goals have to negotiate. Vast societal resources are expended on litigation, labor strikes, divorce disputes, and violence after failed peace talks because the same self-serving biases are at work fomenting hypocritical indignation. In these high-pressure situations, the lawyers (real and metaphorical) are working round the clock to spin and distort the case in their clients’favor. George Loewenstein23and his colleagues at Carnegie Mellon found a way to study the process by giving pairs of research subjects a real legal case to read (about a motorcycle accident, in Texas), assigning one subject to play the",480
Page 85,"70 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s defendant and one the plaintiff, and then giving them real money to nego­ tiate with. Each pair was told to reach a fair agreement and warned that, if they failed to agree, a settlement would be imposed and “court costs” de­ ducted from the pool of money, leaving both players worse off. When both players knew which role each was to play from the start, each read the case materials differently, made different guesses about what settlement the judge in the real case had imposed, and argued in a biased way. More than a quarter of all pairs failed to reach an agreement: However, when the play­ ers didn’t know which role they were to play until after they had read all the materials, they became much more reasonable, and only 6 percent of pairs failed to settle. Recognizing that hiding negotiators’ identities from them until the last mihute is not an option in the real world, Loewenstein set out to find other ways to “de-bias” negotiators. He tried having subjects read a short essay about the kinds of self-serving biases that affect people in their situation to see whether subjects could correct for the biases. No dice. Although the subjects used the information to predict their opponent’s behavior more accurately, they did not change their own biases at all. As Epley and Dun­ ning had found, people really are open to information that will predict the behavior of others, but they refuse to adjust their self-assessments. In an­ other study, Loewenstein followed the advice often given by marriage ther­ apists to have each subject first write an essay arguing the other person’s case as convincingly as possible. Even worse than no dice. The manipula­ tion backfired, perhaps because thinking about your opponent’s arguments automatically triggers additional thinking on your own part as you prepare to refute them. One manipulation did work. When subjects read the essay about self- serving biases and were then asked to write an essay about weaknesses in their own case, their previous righteousness was shaken. Subjects in this study were just as fair-minded as those who learned their identities at the last minute. But before you get too optimistic about this technique for re­ ducing hypocrisy, you should realize that Loewenstein was asking subjects to find weaknesses in their cases—in the positions they were arguing for—not in theircharacters. When you tryto persuade people to lookat their own per­",517
Page 86,"The Faults of Others 71 sonal picture of Dorian Gray, they put up a much bigger fight. Emily Pronin at Princeton and Lee Ross at Stanford have tried to help people overcome their self-servingbiases by teaching them about biases and then asking, “OK, now that you know about these biases, do you want to change what you just said about yourself?”Across many studies, the results were the same:24 People were quite happy to learn about the various forms of self-servingbias and then apply their newfound knowledge to predict others’responses. But their self-ratings were unaffected. Even when you grab people by the lapels, shake them, and say, “Listen to me! Most people have an inflated view of themselves. Be realistic!”they refuse, muttering to themselves, “Well, other people may be biased, but I reallyam above average on leadership.” Pronin and Ross trace this resistance to a phenomenon they call “naive realism”: Eadi of us thinks we see the world directly, as it really is. We fur­ ther believe that the facts as we see them are there for all to see, therefore others should agree with us. If they don’t agree, it follows either that they have not yet been exposed to the relevant facts or else that they are blinded by their interests and ideologies. People acknowledge that their own back­ grounds have shaped their views, but such experiences are invariably seen as deepening ones insights; for example, being a doctor gives a person special insight into the problems of the health-care industry. But the background of other people is used to explain their biases and covert motivations; for exam­ ple, doctors think that lawyers disagree with them about tort reform not be­ cause they work with the victims of malpractice (and therefore have their own special insights) but because their self-interest biases their thinking. It just seems plain as day, to the naive realist, that everyone is influenced by ideology and self-interest. Except for me. I see things as they are. If I could nominate one candidate for “biggest obstacle to world peace and social harmony,”it would be naive realism because it is so easily ratch­ eted up from the individual to the group level: My group is right because we see things as they are. Those who disagree are obviously biased by their religion, their ideology, or their self-interest. Naive realism gives us a world full of good apd evil, and this brings us to the most disturbing implication of the sages’advice about hypocrisy: Good and evil do not exist outside of our beliefs about them.",533
Page 87,"72 T h e H a p p i n e Hy p o t h e s i s Sa t a n Sa t i s f i e s One day in 1998 I received a handwritten letter from a woman in my town whom I did not know. The woman wrote about how crime, drugs, and teen pregnancy were all spiraling out of control. Society was going downhill as Satan spread his wings. The woman invited me to come to her church and find spiritual shelter. As I read her letter, I had to agree with her that Satan had spread his wings, but only to fly away and leave us in peace. The late 1990s was a golden age. The cold war was over, democracy arid human rights were spreading, South Africa had vanquished apartheid, Israelis and Palestinians were reaping the fruits of the Oslo accords, and there were en­ couraging signs from North Korea. Here in the United States, crime and unemployment had plummeted, the stock market was climbing ever higher, and the ensuing prosperity was promising to erase the national debt. Even cockroaches were disappearing from our cities because of widespread use of the roach poison Combat. So what on earth was she talking about? When the moral history of the 1990s is written, it might be titled Desper­ ately Seeking Satan. With peace and harmony ascendant, Americans seemed to be searching for substitute villains. We tried drug dealers (but then the crack epidemic waned) and child abductors (who are usually one of the par­ ents). The cultural right vilified homosexuals; the left vilified racists and ho- mophobes. As I thought about these various villains, including the older villains of communism and Satan himself, I realized that most of them share three properties: They are invisible (you can’t identify the evil one from ap­ pearance alone); their evil spreads by contagion, making it vital to protect impressionable young people from infection (for example from communist ideas, homosexual teachers, or stereotypes on television); and the villains can be defeated only if we all pull together as a team. Ifbecame clear to me that people want to believe they are on a mission from God, or that they are fighting for some more secular good (animals, fetuses, womens rights), and you can’t have much of a mission without good allies and a good enemy. The problem of evil has bedeviled many religions since their birth. If God is all good and all powerful, either he allows evil to flourish (which means he is not all good), or else he struggles against evil (which means he is not all powerful). Religions have generally chosen one of three resolutions of this",560
Page 88,"The Faults ofOthers 73 paradox.25One solution is straight dualism: There exists a good force and an evil force, they are equal and opposite, and they fight eternally. Human be­ ings are part of the battleground. We were created part good, part evil, and we must choose which side we will be on. This view is clearest in religions emanating from Persia and Babylonia, such as Zoroastrianism, and the view influenced Christianity as a long-lived doctrine called Manichaeism. A sec­ ond resolution is straight monism: There is one God; he created the world as it needs to be, and evil is an illusion, aview that dominated religions that de­ veloped in India. These religions hold that the entire world—or, at least, its emotional grip upon us—is an illusion, and that enlightenment consists of breaking out of the illusion. The third approach, taken by Christianity, blends monism and dualism in a way that ultimately reconciles the goodness and power of God with the existence of Satan. This argument is so compli­ cated that I cannot understand it. Nor, apparently, can many Christians who, judging by what I hear on gospel radio stations in Virginia, seem to hold a straight Manichaean world view, according to which God and Satan are fighting an eternal war. In fact, despite the diversityof theological arguments made in different religions, concrete representations of Satan, demons, and other evil entities are surprisingly similar across continents and eras.26 From a psychological perspective, Manichaeism makes perfect sense. “Our life is the creation ofour mind,”as Buddha said, and our minds evolved to play Machiavellian tit for tat. We all commit selfish and shortsighted acts, but our inner lawyer ensures that we do not blame ourselves or our allies for them. We are thus convinced of our own virtue, but quick to seebias, greed, and duplicity in others. We are often correct about others' motives, but as any conflict escalates we begin to exaggerate grossly, to weave a story in which pure virtue (our side) is in a battle with pure vice (theirs). T h e M y t h o f P u r e E v i l In the days after receiving that letter, I thought a lot about the need for evil. I decided to write an article on this need and use the tools of modern psy­ chology to understand evil in a new way. But as soon as I started my re­ search, I found out I was too late. By one year. A three-thousand-year-old",548
Page 89,"74 T h e Ha p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s question had been given a complete and compelling psychological explana­ tion the previous year by Roy Baumeister, one of todays most creative social psychologists. In Evil: Inside Human Cruelty and Aggression,27 Baumeister examined evil from the perspective of both victim and perpetrator. When taking the perpetrators perspective, he found that people who do things we see as evil, from spousal abuse all the way to genocide, rarely think they are doing anything wrong. They almost always see themselves as responding to attacks and provocations in ways that are justified. They often think that they themselves are victims. But, of course, you can see right through this tactic; you are good at understanding the biases that others use to protect their self-esteem. The disturbing part is that Baumeister shows us our own distortions as victims, and as righteous advocates of victims. Almost every­ where Baumeister looked in the research literature, he found that victims often shared some of the blame. Most murders result from an escalating cy­ cle of provocation and retaliation; often, the corpse couldjust as easily have been the murderer. In half of all domestic disputes, both sides used vio­ lence.28Baumeister points out that, even in instances of obvious police bru­ tality, such as the infamous videotaped beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles in 1991, there is usually much more to the story than is shown on the news. (News programs gain viewers by satisfying peoples need to be­ lieve that evil stalks the land.) Baumeister is an extraordinary social psychologist, in part because in his search for truth he is unconcerned about political correctness. Sometimes evil falls out of a clear blue sky onto the head of an innocent victim, but most cases are much more complicated, and Baumeister is willing to vio­ late the taboo against “blaming the victim” in order to understand what really happened. People usually have reasons for committing violence, and those reasons usually involve retaliation for a perceived injustice, or self- defense. This does not mean that both sides are equally to blame: Perpe­ trators often grossly overreact and misinterpret (using self-serving biases). But Baumeister’spoint is that we have a deep need to understand violence and cruelty through what he calls “the myth of pure evil.” Of this myths many parts, the most important are that evildoers are pure in their evil motives (they have no motives for their actions beyond sadism and greed);",537
Page 90,"The Faults of Others 75 victims are pure in their victimhood (they did nothing to bring about their victimization); and evil comes from outside and is associated with a group or force that attacks our group. Furthermore, anyone who questions the application of the myth, who dares muddy the waters of moral certainty, is in league with evil. The myth of pure evil is the ultimate self-serving bias, the ultimate form of naive realism. And it is the ultimate cause of most long-running cycles of violence hecause both sides use it to lock themselves into a Manichaean struggle. When George W. Bush said that the 9/11 terrorists did what they did because they “hate our freedom,”he showed a stunning lack of psycho­ logical insight. Neither the 9/11 hijackers nor Osama Bin Laden were par­ ticularly upset because American women can drive, vote, and wear bikinis. Rather, many Islamic extremists want to kill Americans because they are using the Myth of Pure Evil to interpret Arab history and current events. They seeAmerica as the Great Satan, the current villain in a long pageant of Western humiliation of Arab nations and peoples. They did what they did as a reaction to Americas actions and impact in the Middle East, as they see it through the distortions of the Myth of Pure Evil. However hor­ rifying it is for terrorists to lump all civilians into the category of “enemy” and then kill them indiscriminately, such actions at least make psychologi­ cal sense, whereas killing because of a hatred for freedom does not. In another unsettling conclusion, Baumeister found that violence and cruelty have four main causes. The first two are obvious attributes of evil: greed/ambition (violence for direct personal gain, as in robbery) and sadism (pleasure in hurting people). But greed/ambition explains only a small por­ tion ofviolence, and sadism explains almost none. Outside of children scar­ toons and horror films, people almost never hurt others for the sheerjoy of hurting someone. The two biggest causes of evil are two that we think are good, and that we try to encourage in our children: high self-esteem and moral idealism. Having high self-esteem doesn't directly cause violence, but when someoneshigh esteem is unrealistic or narcissistic, it is easily threat­ ened by reality; in reaction to those threats, people—particularly young men—often lash out violently.29 Baumeister questions the usefulness of programs that try raise childrens self-esteem directly instead of by teaching",525
Page 91,"76 T h e H a p p i n eHsy p o t h e s i s them skills they can be proud of. Such direct enhancement can potentially foster unstable narcissism. Threatened self-esteem accounts for a large portion of violence at the individual level, but to really get a mass atrocity going you need idealism— the belief that yourviolence is a means to a moral end. The major atrocities of the twentieth century were carried out largely either by men who thought they were creating a utopia or else by men who believed they were defending their homeland or tribe from attack.30 Idealism easily becomes dangerous because it brings with it, almost inevitably, the belief that the ends justify the means. If you are fighting for good or for God, what mat­ ters is the outcome, not the path. People have little respect for rules; we re­ spect the moral principles that underlie most rules. But when a moral mission and legal rules are incompatible, we usually care more about the mission. The psychologist Linda Skitka31 finds that when people have strong moral feelings about a controversial issue—when they have a “moral mandate”—they care much less about procedural fairness in court cases. They want the “good guys” freed by any means, and the “bad guys” con­ victed by any means. It is thus not surprising that the administration of George W. Bush consistently argues that extra-judicial killings, indefinite imprisonment without trial, and harsh physical treatment of prisoners are legal and proper steps in fighting the Manichaean “war on terror.” F i n d i n gt h e G r e a t W a y In philosophy classes, I often came across the idea that the world is an illu­ sion. I never reallyknew what that meant, although it sounded deep. But af­ ter two decades studying moral psychology, I think I finally get it. The anthropologist Clifford Geertz wrote that “man is an animal suspended in webs of significance that he himself has spun.”32That is, the world we live in is not really one made of rocks, trees, and physical objects; it is a world of insults, opportunities, status symbols, betrayals, saints, and sinners. All of these are human creations which, though real in their own way, are not real in the way that rocks and trees are real. These human creations are like",496
Page 92,"The Faults of Others 77 fairies in J. M. Barries Peter Pan: They exist only if you believe in them. They are the Matrix (from the movie of that name); they are a consensual hallucination. The inner lawyer, the rose-colored mirror, naive realism, and the myth of pure evil— these mechanisms all conspire to weave for us a web of signifi­ cance upon which angels and demons fight it out. Our ever-judging minds then give us constant flashes of approval and disapproval, along with the certainty that we are on the side of the angels. From this vantage point it all seems so silly, all this moralism, righteousness, and hypocrisy. Its be­ yond silly; it is tragic, for it suggests that human beings will never achieve a state of lasting peace and harmony. So what can you do about it? The first step is to see it as a game and stop taking it so seriously. The great lesson that comes out of ancient India is that life as we experience it is a game called “samsara.” It is a game in which each person plays out his “dharma,” his role or part in a giant play. In the game of samsara, good things happen to you, and you are happy. Then bad things happen, and you are sad or angry. And so it goes, until you die. Then you are reborn back into it, and it repeats. The message of the Bhagavad Gita (a central text of Hinduism) is that you can’t quit the game entirely; you have a role to play in the functioning of the universe, and you must play that role. But you should do it in the right way, without being attached to the “fruits”or out­ comes of your action. The god Krishna says: I love the man who hates not nor exults, who mourns not nor desires . . . who is the same to friend and foe, [the same] whetherhe be respected or despised, the same in heat and cold, in pleasure and in pain, who has put away attachment and remains unmoved by praise or blame . . . con­ tented with whatever comes his way.33 Buddha went a step further. He, too, counseled indifference to the ups and downs of life, but he urged that we quit the game entirely. Buddhism is a set of practices for escaping samsara and the endless cycle of rebirth. Though divided on whether to retreat from the world or engage with it, Bud­ dhists all agree on the importance of training the mind to stop its incessant",547
Page 93,"78 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s judging. Sen-ts’an, an early Chinese Zen master, urged nonjudgmentalism as a prerequisite to following “the perfect way” in this poem from the eighth century CE: The Perfect Wayis only difficultfor thosewho pick and choose; Do not like, do not dislike; all will then be clear. Make a hairbreadth difference, and Heaven and Earth are , set apart; Ifyou want the truth to stand clear before you, never befor oragainst. Thestruggle between “for"" and “against”is the mind’sworst disease}4 Judgmentalism is indeed a disease of the mind: it leads to anger, torment, and conflict. But it is also the minds normal condition—the elephant is al­ ways evaluating, always saying “Like it” or “Don’t like it.” So how can you change your automatic reactions?You know by now that you can’t simply re­ solve to stop judging others or to stop being a hypocrite. But, as Buddha taught, the rider can gradually learn to tame the elephant, and meditation is one way to do so. Meditation has been shown to make people calmer, less reactive to the ups and downs and petty provocations of life.35Meditation is the Eastern way of training yourself to take things philosophically. Cognitive therapy works, too. In Feeling Good,36a popular guide to cog­ nitive therapy, David Bums has written a chapter on cognitive therapy for anger. He advises using many of the same techniques that Aaron Beck used for depression: Write down your thoughts, learn to recognize the dis­ tortions in your thoughts, and then think of a more appropriate thought. Bums focuses on the should statements we carry around—ideas about how the world should work, and about how people should treat us. Violations of these should statements are the major causes of anger and resentment. Burns also advises empathy: In a conflict, look at the world from your op­ ponent’spoint of view, and you’ll see that she is not entirely crazy. Although I agree with Burns’s general approach, the material I have re­ viewed in this chapter suggests that, once anger comes into play, people",472
Page 94,"The Faults of Others 79 find it extremely difficult to empathize with and understand another per­ spective. A better place to start is, as Jesus advised, with yourself and the log in your own eye. (Batson and Loewenstein both found that debiasing occurred only when subjects were forced to look at themselves.) And you will see the log only if you set out on a deliberate and effortful quest to look for it. Try this now: Think of a recent interpersonal conflict with someone you care about and then find one way in which your behavior was not ex­ emplary. Maybe you did something insensitive (even if you had a right to do it), or hurtful (even if you meant well), or inconsistent with your princi­ ples (even though you can readilyjustify it). When you first catch sight of a fault in yourself, you’ll likely hear frantic arguments from your inner lawyer excusing you and blaming others, but try not to listen. You are on a mission to find at least one thing that you did wrong. When you extract a splinter it hurts, briefly, but then you feel relief, even pleasure. When you find a fault in yourself it will hurt, briefly, but if you keep going and acknowledge the fault, you are likely to be rewarded with a flash of pleasure that is mixed, oddly, with a hint of pride. It is the pleasure of taking responsibility for your own behavior. It is the feeling of honor. Finding fault with yourselfis also the key to overcoming the hypocrisy and judgmentalism that damage so many valuable relationships. The instant you see some contribution you made to a conflict, your anger softens—maybe just a bit, but enough that you might beable to acknowledge some merit on the other side. You can still believe you are right and the other person is wrong, but if you can move to believing that you are mostly right, and your opponent is mostlywrong, you have the basis for an effective and nonhumili­ ating apology. You can take a small piece of the disagreement and say, “I should not have done X, and I can seewhy you feltY.”Then, by the power of reciprocity, the other person will likely feel a strong urge to say, ‘Yes, I was really upset byX. But I guess I shouldn’t have done P, so I can see why you felt Q.” Reciprocity amplified by self-serving biases drove you apart back when you were matching insults or hostile gestures, but you can turn the process around and use reciprocity to end a conflict and save a relationship. The human mind may have been shaped by evolutionary processes to play Machiavellian tit for tat, and it seems to come equipped with cognitive processes that predispose us to hypocrisy, self-righteousness, and moralistic",583

So I became great arid surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem; also my wisdom remained with me. Whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them. ( Ec c l e s i a 2 :4 - 1 0 ) But in what may be one of the earliest reports of a midlife crisis, the au­ thor finds it all pointless: Then I considered all that my hands had done and the toil I had spent in doingit, and again, all wasvanityand a chasing afterwind, and there was nothing to be gained under the sun. ( E c c l e s i a s:1 ) s 2 The author tells us about many other avenues he pursued—hard work, learning, wine—but nothing brought satisfaction; nothing could banish the feeling that his life had no more intrinsic worth or purpose than that of an animal. From the perspective of Buddha and the Stoic philosopher Epicte­ tus, the authors problem is obvious: his pursuit of happiness. Buddhism and Stoicism teach that strivingfor external goods, or to make the world conform to your wishes, is always a striving after wind. Happiness can only be found within, by breaking attachments to external things and cultivating an atti­ tude of acceptance. (Stoics and Buddhists can have relationships, jobs, and possessions, but, to avoid becoming upset upon losing them, they must not be emotionally attached.to them.) This idea is of course an extension of the truth of chapter 2: life itself is but what you deem it, and your mental state determines how you deem things. But recent research in psychology sug­ gests that Buddha and Epictetus may have taken things too fan Some things are worth striving for, and happiness comes in part from outside of yourself, if you know where to look.

Page 98,"The Pursuit ofHappiness 83 what you want is often fleeting. You dream about getting a promotion, be­ ing accepted into a prestigious school, or finishing a big project. You work everywaking hour, perhaps imagining how happy you’d be if you could just achieve that goal. Then you succeed, and if you’re lucky you get an hour, maybe a day, of euphoria, particularly if your success was unexpected and there was a moment in which it was revealed (. . . the envelope, please). More typically, however, you don’t get any euphoria. When success seems increasingly probable and some final event confirms what you already had begun to expect, the feeling is more one of relief—the pleasure of closure and release. In such circumstances, my first thought is seldom “Hooray! Fantastic!”; it is “Okay, what do I have to do now?” My undeijoyed response to success turns out to be normal. And from an evolutionarypoint ofview, it’seven sensible.Animals get arush of dopamine, the pleasure neurotransmitter, whenever they do something that advances their evolutionary interests and moves them ahead in the game of life. Food and sexgive pleasure, and that pleasure serves as a reinforcer (in behaviorist terms) that motivates laterefforts to find food and sex. For humans, however, the game is more complex. People win at the game of life by achieving high status and a good reputation, cultivating friendships, finding the best mate(s), accumulating resources, and rearing their children to be successful at the same game. People have many goals and therefore many sources of pleasure. Soyou’d thinkwe would receive an enormous ar^dlong-lasting shot of dopamine whenever we succeed at an important goal. But here’sthe trick with reinforcement: It works best when it comes seconds—not minutes or hours—after the behavior. Just try training your dog to fetch by giving him a big steakten minutes after each successful retrieval. It can’t be done. The elephant works the same way: Itfeels pleasurewhenever it takes a step in the rightdirection. The elephant learns whenever pleasure (orpain) follows immediately after behavior, but it has trouble connecting success on Friday with actions it took on Monday. Richard Davidson, the psychologist who brought us affective style and the approach circuits of the front left cortex, writes about two types of positive affect. The first he calls “pre-goal attain­ ment positive affect,” which is the pleasurable feeling you get as you make progress toward a goal. The second is called “post-goal attainment positive af­ fect,” which Davidson says arises once you.have achieved something you",547
Page 99,"84 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s want.3You experience this latter feeling as contentment, as a short-lived feel­ ing of release when the left prefrontal cortex reduces its activity after a goal has been achieved. In other words, when it comes to goal pursuit, it really is the journey that counts, not the destination. Set for yourself any goal you want. Most of the pleasure will be had along the way, with every step that takes you closer. The final moment of success is often no more thrilling than the reliefof taking off a heavybackpack at the end ofa longhike. If you went on the hike onlyto feel that pleasure, you are a fool. Yetpeople sometimes do just this. They work hard at a task and expect some special euphoria at the end. But when they achieve success and find only moderate and short-lived pleasure, they ask (as the singer Peggy Lee once did): Is that all there is? They devalue their accomplishments as a striving after wind. We can call this “the progress principle”: Pleasure comes more from mak­ ing progress toward goals than from achieving them. Shakespeare captured it perfectly: “Things won are done;joys soul lies in the doing.”4 T h e A d a p t a t i o nP r i n c i p l e If I gave you ten seconds to name the very best and very worst things that could ever happen to you, you might well come up with these: winning a 20-million-dollar lottery jackpot and becoming paralyzed from the neck down. Winning the lottery would bring freedom from so many cares and limitations; it would enable you to pursue your dreams, help others, and live in comfort, so it ought to bring long-lasting happiness rather than one serv­ ing of dopamine. Losing the use of your body, on the other hand, would bring more limitations than life in prison. You’d have to give up on nearly all your goals and dreams, forget about sex, and depend on other people for help with eating and bathroom functions. Many people think they would rather be dead than paraplegic. But they are mistaken. Of course, its better towin the lottery than to breakyour neck, but not by as much as you’d think. Because whatever happens, you’re likely to adapt to it, but you don’t realize up front that you will. We are bad at “affective fore­ casting,”5that is, predicting how we’ll feel in the future. We grosslyoveresti­",534
Page 100,"The Pursuit ofHappiness 85 mate the intensity and the duration of our emotional reactions. Within a year, lotterywinners and paraplegics have both (on average) returned most of the way to their baseline levels of happiness.6The lotterywinner buys a new house and a new car, quits her boring job, and eats better food. She gets a kick out of the contrast with her former life, but within a few months the contrast blurs and the pleasure fades. The human mind is extraordinarily sensitive to changes in conditions, but not so sensitive to absolute levels. The winners pleasure comes from rising in wealth, not from standing still at a high level, and after a few months the new comforts have become the new baseline of daily life. The winner takes them for granted and has no way to rise any further. Even worse: The money might damage her relationships. Friends, relatives, swindlers, and sobbing strangers swarm around lottery winners, suing them, sucking up to them, demanding a share of the wealth. (Remember the ubiquity of self-servingbiases; everyone can find a reason to be owed something.) Lottery winners are so often harassed that many have to move, hide, end relationships, and finally turn to each other, forming lot­ terywinner support groups to deal with their new difficulties.7(It should be noted, however, that nearly all lotterywinners are still glad that they won.) At the other extreme, the quadriplegic takes a huge happiness loss up front. He thinks his life is over, and it hurts to give up everything he once hbped for. But like the lottery winner, his mind is sensitive more to changes than to absolute levels, so after a few months he has begun adapting to his new situation and is setting more modest goals. He discovers that physical therapy can expand his abilities. He has nowhere to go but up, and each step gives him the pleasure of the progress principle. The physicist Stephen Hawking has been trapped in a shell of a body since his early twenties, when he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease. Yet he went on to solve major problems in cosmology, win many prizes, and write the best-selling science book of all time. During a recent interview in the New York Times, he was asked how he keeps his spirits up. He replied: “My expectations were reduced to zero when I was twenty-one. Everything since then has been a bonus.”8 This is the adaptation principle at work: Peoples judgments about their present state are based on whether it is better or worse than the state to",530
Page 101,"86 T h e H a p p i n e Hy p o t h e s i s which they have become accustomed.9Adaptation is, in part, just a property of neurons: Nerve cells respond vigorously to new stimuli, but gradually they “habituate,” firing less to stimuli that they have become used to. It is change that contains vital information, not steady states. Human beings, however, take adaptation to cognitive extremes. We don’tjust habituate, we recalibrate. We create for ourselves a world of targets, and each time we hit one we replace it with another. After a string of successes we aim higher; af­ ter a massive setback, such as a broken neck, we aim low£r. Instead of fol­ lowing Buddhist and Stoic advice to surrender attachments and let events happen, we surround ourselves with goals, hopes, and expectations, and then feel pleasure and pain in relation to our progress.10 When we combine the adaptation principle with the discovery that peoples average level of happiness is highly heritable,11we come to a star­ tling possibility: In the long run, it doesn’t much matter what happens to you. Good fortune or bad, you will always return to your happiness set- point—your brain’s default level of happiness— which was determined largely by your genes. In 1759, long before anyone knew about genes, Adam Smith reached the same conclusion: s In every permanent situation, where there is no expectation of change, the mind of everyman, in a longer or shorter time, returns to its natural and usual state of tranquility. In prosperity, after a certain time, it fa1ls back to that state; in adversity, after a certain time, it rises up to it.12 If this idea is correct, then we are all stuck on what has been called the “hedonic treadmill.”13On an exercise treadmill you can increase the speed all you want, but you stay in the same place. In life, you can work as hard as you want, and accumulate all the riches, fruit trees, and concubines you want, but you can’t get ahead. Because you can’t change your “natural and usual state of tranquility,”the riches you accumulate will just raise your ex­ pectations and leave you no better off than you were before. Yet, not realiz­ ing the futility of our efforts, we continue to strive, all the while doing things that help us win at the game of life. Always wanting more than we have, we run and run and run, like hamsters on a wheel.",537
Page 102,"The Pursuit ofHappiness 87 A n E a r l y H a p p i n e s H y p o t h e s i s Buddha, Epictetus, and many other sages saw the futility of the rat race and urged people to quit. They proposed a particular happiness hypothesis: Happiness comesfrom within, and it cannot befound by making the world conform toyour desires. Buddhism teaches that attachment leads inevitably to suffering and offers tools for breaking attachments. The Stoic philoso­ phers ofAncient Greece, such as Epictetus, taught their followers to focus only on what they could fully control, which meant primarily their own thoughts and reactions. All other events— the gifts and curses of fortune— were externals, and the true Stoic was unaffected by externals. Neither Buddha nor the Stoics urged people to withdraw into a cave. In fact, both doctrines have such enduring appeal precisely because they offer guidance on how to find peace and happiness while participating in a treacherous and ever-changing social world. Both doctrines are based on an empirical claim, a happiness hypothesis that asserts that striving to obtain goods and goals in the external world cannot bring you more than momen­ tary happiness. You must work on your internal world. If the hypothesis is true, it has profound implications for how we should live our lives, raise our children, and spend our money But is it true? It all depends on what kind of externals we are talking about. The second biggest finding in happiness research, after the strong influ­ ence of genes upon a persons average level of happiness, is that most en­ vironmental and demographic factors influence happiness very little. Try to imagine yourself changing places with either Bob or Mary. Bob is thirty-five years old, single, white, attractive, and athletic: He earns $100,000 a year and lives in sunny Southern California. He is highly intellectual, and he spends his free time reading and going to museums. Mary and her husband live in snowy Buffalo, New York, where they earn a combined income of $40,000. Mary is sixty-fiveyears old, black, overweight, and plain in appear­ ance. She is highly sociable, and she spends her free time mostly in activi­ ties related to her church. She is on dialysis for kidney problems. Bob seems to have it all, and few readers of this book would prefer Marys life to his. Yet if you had to bet on it, you should bet that Mary is happier than Bob.",523
Page 103,"88 T h e H a p p i n eHsy p o t h e s i s What Mary has that Bob lacks are strong connections. A good marriage is one of the life-factors most strongly and consistently associated with happiness.14Part of this apparent benefit comes from “reverse correlation”: Happiness causes marriage. Happy people marry sooner and stay married longer than people with a lower happiness setpoint, both because they are more appealing as dating partners and because they are easier to live with as spouses.15But much of the apparent benefit is a real and lasting benefit of dependable companionship, which is a basic need; we never fully adapt either to it or to its absence.16Mary also has religion, and religious people are happier, on average, than nonreligious people.17This effect arises from the social ties that come with participation in a religious community, as well as from feeling connected to something beyond the self. What Bob has going for him is a string of objective advantages in power, status, freedom, health, and sunshine—all of which are subject to the adapta­ tion principle. WhiteAmericans arefreed from many of the hassles and indig­ nities that affect blackAmericans, yet, on average, they are only very slightly happier.18Men have more freedom and power than women, yet they are not on average any happier. (Women experience more depression, but also more intensejoy).19The young have somuch more to look forward to than the eld­ erly, yet ratings of life satisfaction actually rise slightly with age, up to age sixty-five, and, in some studies, well beyond.20People are often surprised to hear that the old are happier than the young because the old have so many more health problems, yet people adapt to most chronic health problems such as Marys21 (although ailments that grow progressively worse do reduce well-being, and a recent study finds that adaptation to disability is not, on av­ erage, complete).22 People who live in cold climates expect people who live in Californiatobe happier, but theyarewrong.23People believe that attractive people ate happier than unattractive people,24but they, too, are wrong.25 The one thing Bob does have going for him is wealth, but here the story is complicated. The most widely reported conclusion, from surveys done by psychologist Ed Diener,26is that within any given country, at the lowest end of the income scale money does buy happiness: People who worry every day about paying for food and shelter report significantly less well-being than those who don’t. But once you are freed from basic needs and have entered",541
Page 104,"The Pursuit ofHappiness 89 the middle class, the relationship between wealth and happiness becomes smaller. The rich are happier on average than the middle class, but only by a little, and part of this relationship is reverse correlation: Happy people grow rich faster because, as in the marriage market, they are more appeal­ ing to others (such as bosses), and also because their frequent positive emotions help them to commit to projects, to work hard, and to invest in their futures.27Wealth itself has only a small direct effect on happiness be­ cause it so effectively speeds up the hedonic treadmill. For example, as the level of wealth has doubled or tripled in the last fifty years in many indus­ trialized nations, the levels of happiness and satisfaction with life that people report have not changed, and depression has actually become more common.28Vast increases in gross domestic product led to improvements in the comforts of life—a larger home, more cars, televisions, and restau­ rant meals, better health and longer life—but these improvements became the normal conditions of life; all were adapted to and taken for granted, so they did not make people feel any happier or more satisfied. These findings would have pleased Buddha and Epictetus—if, that is, they found pleasure in such external events as being proved right. As in their day, people today devote themselves to the pursuit of goals that wont make them happier, in the process neglecting the sort of inner growth and spiritual development that could bring lasting satisfaction. One of the most consistent lessons the ancient sages teach is to let go, stop striving, and choose a new path. Turn inward^, or toward God, but for Gods sake stop trying to make the world conform to your will. The Bhagavad Gita is a Hindu treatise on nonattachment. In a section on “human devils,” the god Krishna describes humanity’slower nature and the people who give in to it: “Bound by hundreds of fetters forged by hope, obsessed by anger and de­ sire, they seek to build up wealth unjustly to satisfy their lusts.”29 Krishna then parodies the thinking of such a devil: This have I gained today, this whim 111satisfy; this wealth is mine and much more too will be mine as time goes on. He was an enemy of mine, I’ve killed him, and many another too I’ll kill. I’m master here. I take my pleasure as I will. I’m strongand happy and successful.",518
Page 105,"90 Th e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s Substitute “defeat” for “kill” and you have a pretty good description of the modem Western ideal, at least in some corners of the business world. So even if Bob were just as happy as Mary, if he has an arrogant, entitled attitude and treats people badly, his life would still be spiritually and aes­ thetically worse. T h e H a p p i n e s sFo r m u l a In the 1990s, the two big findings of happiness research (strong relation to genes, weak relation to environment) hit the psychological community hard, because they applied not just to happiness but to most aspects of personality. Psychologists since Freud had shared a nearly religious devo­ tion to the idea that personality is shaped primarily by childhood environ­ ment. This axiom was taken on faith: The evidence for it consisted almost entirely of correlations— usually small ones—between what parents did and how their children turned out, and anyone who suggested that these correlations were caused by genes was dismissed as a reductionist. But as twin studies revealed the awesome reach of genes and the relative unim­ portance of the family environment that siblings share,30the ancient hap­ piness hypothesis grew ever more plausible. Maybe there really is a set point31 fixed into every brain, like a thermostat set forever to 58 degrees Fahrenheit (for depressives) or 75 degrees (for happy people)? Maybe the only way to find happiness therefore is to change ones own internal setting (for example, through meditation, Prozac, or cognitive therapy) instead of changing ones environment? As psychologists wrestled with-these ideas, however, and as biologists worked out the first sketch of the human genome, a more sophisticated un­ derstanding of nature and nurture began to emerge. Yes, genes explain far more about us than anyone had realized, but the genes themselves often turn out to be sensitive to environmental conditions.32And yes, each person has a characteristic level of happiness, but it now looks as though its not so much a set point as a potential range or probability distribution. Whether you oper­ ate on the high or the low side ofyour potential range is determined bymany factors that Buddha and Epictetus would have considered externals.",479
Page 106,"The Pursuit ofHappiness 91 When Martin Seligman founded positive psychology in the late 1990s, one of his first moves was to bring together small groups of experts to tackle specific problems. One group was created to study the externals that matter for happiness. Three psychologists, Sonja Lyubomirsky, Ken Shel­ don, and David Schkade, reviewed the available evidence and realized that there are two fundamentally different kinds of externals: the conditions of your life and the voluntary activities that you undertake .33Conditions in­ clude facts about your life that you can’t change (race, sex, age, disability) as well as things that you can (wealth, marital status, where you live). Con­ ditions are constant over time, at least during a period in your life, and so they are the sorts of things that you are likely to adapt to. Voluntary activi­ ties, on the other hand, are the things that you choose to do, such as medi­ tation, exercise, learning a new skill, or taking a vacation. Because such activities must be chosen, and because most of them take effort and atten­ tion, they can’tjust disappear from your awareness the way conditions can. Voluntary activities, therefore, offer much greater promise for increasing happiness while avoiding adaptation effects. One of the most important ideas in positive psychology is what Lyubo­ mirsky, Sheldon, Schkade, and Seligman call the “happiness formula:” H = S +C +V The level of happiness that you actually experience (H) is determined by your biological set point (S) plus the conditions of your life (C) plus the voluntary activities (V) you do.?4The challenge for positive psychology is to use the scientific method to find out exactly what kinds of C and V can push H up to the top of your potential range. The extreme biological ver­ sion of the happiness hypothesis says that H = S, and that C and V don’t matter. But we have to give Buddha and Epictetus credit for V because Buddha prescribed the “eightfold noble path” (including meditation and mindfulness), and Epictetus urged methods of thought to cultivate indif­ ference (apatheia) to externals. So to test the wisdom of the sages properly we must examine this hypothesis: H = S +V, where V = voluntary or inten­ tional activities that cultivate acceptance and weaken emotional attach­ ments. If there are many conditions (C) that matter, and if there are a",533
Page 107,"92 T h e H a p p i n eHsy p o t h e s i s variety of voluntary activities beyond those aimed at nonattachment, then the happiness hypothesis of Buddha and Epictetus is wrong and people would be poorly advised simply to look within. It turns out that there really are some external conditions (C) that mat­ ter. There are some changes you can make in your life that are not fully subject to the adaptation principle, and that might make you lastingly hap­ pier. It may be worth striving to achieve them. Noise. When Hived in Philadelphia, I learned a valuable lesson about real estate: If you must buy a house on a busy street, dont buy one within thirty yards of a traffic light. Every ninety-five seconds I had to listen to forty-two seconds of several people's musical selections followed by twelve seconds of engines revving, with an impatient honk thrown in once every fifteen cycles. I never got used to it, and when my wife and I were looking for a house in Charlottesville, I told our agent that if a Victorian mansion were being given away on a busy street, I would not take it. Re­ search shows that people who must adapt to new and chronic sources of noise (such as when a new highway is built) never fully adapt, and even studies that find some adaptation still find evidence of impairment on cognitive tasks. Noise, especially noise that is variable or intermittent, in­ terferes with concentration and increases stress .35Its,worth striving to re­ move sources of noise in your life. Commuting. Many people choose to move farther away from theirjobs in search of a larger house. But although people quickly adapt to having more space ,36they dont fully adapt to the longer commute, particularly if it in­ volves driving in heavy traffic .37 Even after years of commuting, those whose commutes are traffic-filled still arrive at work with higher levels of stress hormones. (Driving under ideal conditions is, however, often enjoy­ able and relaxing .)3Its worth striving to improve your commute. Lack ofcontrol. One of the active ingredients of noise and traffic, the as­ pect that helps them get under your skin, is that you can’t control them. In one classic study, David Glass and Jerome Singer exposed people to loud bursts of random noise. Subjects in one group were told they could termi­",491
Page 108,"The Pursuit ofHappiness 93 nate the noise by pressing a button, but they were asked not to press the button unless it was absolutely necessary. None of these subjects pressed the button, yet the belief that they had some form of control made the noise less distressing to them. In the second part of the experiment, the subjects who thought they had control were more persistent when working on diffi­ cult puzzles, but the subjects who had experienced noise without control gave up more easily .39 In another famous study, Ellen Langer and Judith Rodin gave benefits to residents on two floors of a nursing home—for example, plants in their rooms, and a movie screening one night a week. But on one floor, these benefits came with a sense of control: The residents were allowed to choose which plants they wanted, and they were responsible for watering them. They were allowed to choose as a group which night would be movie night. On the other floor, the same benefits were simply doled out: The nurses chose the plants and watered them; the nurses decided which night was movie night. This small manipulation had big effects: On the floor with increased control, residents were happier, more active, and more alert (as rated by the nurses, not just by the residents), and these benefits were still visible eighteen months later. Most amazingly, at the eighteen-month follow-up, residents of the floor given control had better health and half as many deaths (15 percent versus 30 percent ).40In a review paper that Rodin and I wrote, we concluded that changing an institutions environment to in­ crease the sense of control among its workers, students, patients, or other users was one of the most effective possible ways to increase their sense of engagement, energy, and happiness .41 Shame. /Overall, attractive people are not happier than unattractive ones. Yet, surprisingly, some improvements in a persons appearance do lead to lasting increases in happiness .42People who undergo plastic surgery report (on average) high levels of satisfaction with the process, and they even re­ port increases in the quality of their lives and decreases in psychiatric symp­ toms (such as depression and anxiety) in the years after the operation. The biggest gains were reported for breast surgery, both enlargement and reduc­ tion. I think the way to understand the long-lasting effects of such seem­ ingly shalldw changes is to think about the power of shame in everyday life.",503
Page 109,"94 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s Young women whose breasts are much larger or smaller than their ideal of­ ten report feeling self-consciousness every day about their bodies. Many ad­ just their posture or their wardrobe in an attempt to hide what they see as a personal deficiency. Being freed from such a daily burden may lead to a last­ ing increase in self-confidence and well-being. Relationships. The condition that is usually said 43to trump all others iri importance is the strength and number of a persons relationships. Good relationships make people happy, and happy people enjoy more and better relationships than unhappy people .44This effect is so important and inter­ esting that it gets its own chapter—the next one. For now, Til just mention that conflicts in relationships—having an annoying office mate or room­ mate, or having chronic conflict with your spouse—is one of the surest ways to reduce your happiness. You never adapt to interpersonal conflict ;45 it damages every day, even days when you don’t see the other person but ruminate about the conflict nonetheless. There are many other ways in which you can increase your happiness by getting the conditions of your life right, particularly in relationships, work, and the degree of control you have over stressors. So in the happiness for­ mula, C is real and some externals matter Some things are worth striving for, and positive psychology can help identify them. Of course, Buddha would adapt fully to noise, traffic, lack of control and bodily deficiencies, but it has always been difficult, even in ancient India, for real people to be­ come like Buddha. In the modern Western world, it is even harder to fol­ low Buddhas path of nondoing and nonstriving. Some of our poets and writers in fact urge us to forswear that path and embrace action whole­ heartedly: “It is vain to say that human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquility: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot find it.”( Ch a r l o tBtr o n t, 1 8 4 7 )46 F i n d i n gF l o w Not all action, however, will work. Chasing after wealth and prestige, for example, will usually backfire. People who report the greatest interest in",491
Page 110,"The Pursuit ofHappiness 95 attaining money, fame, or beauty are consistently found to be less happy, and even less healthy, than those who pursue less materialistic goals .47So what is the right kind of activity? What is V in the happiness formula? The tool that helped psychologists answer that question is the '‘experi­ ence sampling method,”invented by Mihalyi Csikszentmihalyi (pronounced “cheeks sent me high”), the Hungarian-born cofounder of positive psychol­ ogy. In Csikszentmihalyis studies ,48 people carry with them a pager that beeps several times a day At each beep, the subject pulls out a small note­ book and records what she is doing at that moment, and how much she is enjoying it. Through this “beeping”of thousands ofpeople tens of thousands of times, Csikszentmihalyi found out what people really enjoy doing, notjust what they rememberhaving enjoyed. He discovered that there are two differ­ ent kinds of enjoyment. One is physical or bodily pleasure. At meal times, people report the highest levels of happiness, on average. People really enjoy eating, especially in the company of others, and they hate to be interrupted by telephone calls (and perhaps Csikszentmihalyis beeps) during meals, or (worst of all) during sex. But you can’t enjoy physical pleasure all day long. By their very nature, food and sex satiate. To continue eating or having sex beyond a certain level of satisfaction can lead to disgu.49 Csikszentmihalyi’s big discovery is that there is a state many people value even more than chocolate after sex. It is the state of total immersion in a task that is challenging yet closely matched to ones abilities. It is what people sometimes call “being in the zone.”Csikszentmihalyi called it “flow” because it often feels like effortless movement: Flow happens, and you go with it. Flow often occurs during physical movement— skiing, driving fast on a curvy country road, or playing team sports. Flow is aided by music or by the action of other people, both of which provide a temporal structure for ones own behavior (for example, singing in a choir, dancing, orjust hav­ ing an intense conversation with a friend). And flow can happen during solitary creative activities, such as painting, writing, or photography. The keys to flow: There’s a clear challenge that fully engages your attention; you have the skills to meet the challenge; and you get immediate feedback about how you are doing at each step (the progress principle). You get flash after flash of positive feeling with each turn negotiated, each high note cor­ rectly sung, or each brushstroke that falls into the right place. In the flow",593
Page 111,"96 Th e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s experience, elephant and rider are in perfect harmony. The elephant (auto­ matic processes) is doing most of the work, running smoothly through the forest, while the rider (conscious thought) is completely absorbed in look­ ing out for problems and opportunities, helping wherever he can. Drawing on Csikszentmihalyi s work, Seligman proposes a fundamental distinction between pleasures and gratifications. Pleasures are “delights that have clear sensory and strong emotional components ,”50such as may be derived from food, sex, backrubs, and cool breezes. Gratifications are activities that engage you fully, draw on your strengths, and allow you to lose self-consciousness. Gratifications can lead to flow. Seligman proposes that V (voluntary activities) is largely a matter of arranging your day and your environment to increase both pleasures and gratifications. Pleasures must be spaced to maintain their potency. Eating a quart of ice cream in an afternoon or listening to a new CD ten times in a row are good ways to overdose and deaden yourself to future pleasure. Here’s where the rider has an important role to play: Because the elephant has a tendency to over­ indulge, the rider needs to encourage it to get up and move on to another activity Pleasures should be both savored and varied. The French know how to do this: They eat many fatty foods, yet they end up thinner and healthier than Americans, and they derive a great deal more pleasure from their food by eating slowly and paying more attention to the food as they eat it .51Be­ cause they savor, they ultimately eat less. Americans, in contrast, shovel enormous servings of high-fat and high-carbohydrate food into their mouths while doing other things. The French also vary their pleasure by serving many small courses; Americans are seduced by restaurants that serve large portions. Variety is the spice of life because it is the natural enemy of adap­ tation. Super-sizingportions, on the other hand, maximizes adaptation. Epi­ curus, one of the few ancient philosophers to embrace sensual pleasure, endorsed the French way when he said that the wise man “chooses not the greatest quantity of food but the most tast.”52 One reason for the widespread philosophical wariness of sensual plea­ sure is that it gives no lasting benefit. Pleasure feels good in the moment, but sensual memories fade quickly, and the person is no wiser or stronger",524
Page 112,"The Pursuit ofHappiness 97 afterwards. Even worse, pleasure beckons people back for more, away from activities that might be better for them in the long run. But gratifications are different. Gratifications ask more of us; they challenge us and make us extend ourselves. Gratifications often come from accomplishing something, learning something, or improving something. When we enter a state of flow, hard work becomes effortless. We want to keep exerting ourselves, honing our skills, using our strengths. Seligman suggests that the key to finding your own gratifications is to know your own strengths .53One of the big ac­ complishments of positive psychology has been the development of a cata­ log of strengths. You can find out your strengths by taking an online test at www.authentichappiness.org. Recently I asked the 350 students in my introductory psychology class to take the strengths test and then, a week later, to engage in four activities over a few days. One of the activities was to indulge the senses, as by tak­ ing a break for ice cream in the middle of the afternoon, and then savoring the ice cream. This activity was the most enjoyable at the time; but, like all pleasures, it faded quickly. The other three activities were potential gratifi­ cations: Attend a lecture or class that you dont normally go to; perform an act of kindness for a friend who could use some cheering up; and write down the reasons you are grateful to someone and later call or visit that person to express your gratitude. The least enjoyable of the four activities was going to a lecture—except for those whose strengths included curios­ ity and love of learning. They got a lot more out of it. The big finding was that people experienced longer-lasting improvements in mood from the kindness and gratitude activities than from those in which they indulged themselves. Even though people were most nervous about doing the kind­ ness and gratitude activities, which required them to violate social norms and risk embarrassment, once they actually did the activities they felt bet­ ter for the rest of the day. Many students even said their good feelings con­ tinued on into the next day—which nobody said about eating ice cream. Furthermore, these benefits were most pronounced for those whose strengths included kindness and gratitude. So V (voluntary activity) is real, and its not just about detachment. You can increase your happiness if you use your strengths, particularly in the",503
Page 113,"98 T h e H a p p i n e Hy p o t h e s i s service of strengthening connections—helping friends, expressing grati­ tude to benefactors. Performing a random act of kindness every day could get tedious, but if you know your strengths and draw up a list of five activi­ ties that engage them, you can surely add at least one gratification to every day. Studies that have assigned people to perform a random act of kindness every week, or to count their blessings regularly for several weeks, find small but sustained increases in happiness .54So take the initiative! Choose your own gratifying activities, do them regularly (but not to the point of te­ dium), and raise your overall level of happiness. M i s g u i d e dP u r s u i t s An axiom of economics is that people pursue their interests more or less ra­ tionally, and thats what makes markets work—Adam Smiths “invisible hand” of self-interest. But in the 1980s, a few economists began studying psychol­ ogy and messing up the prevailing models. Leading the way was the Cornell economist Robert Frank, whose 1987 book Passions Within Reason analyzed some of the things people do that just don’t fit into economic models of pure self-interest—such as tipping in restaurants when far from home, seeking costly revenge, and staying loyal to friends and spouses when better opportu­ nities come along. Frank argued that these behaviors make sense only as products of moral emotions (such as love, shame, vengeance, or guilt), and these moral emotions make sense only as products of evolution. Evolution seems to have made us “strategically irrational” at times for our own good; for example, a person who gets angry when cheated, and who will pursue vengeance regardless of the cost, earns a reputation that discourages would- be cheaters. A person who pursued vengeance only when the benefits out­ weighed the costs could be cheated with impunity in many situations. In his more recent book, Luxury Fever,55Frank used the same approach to understand another kind of irrationality: the vigor with which people pursue many goals that work against their own happiness. Frank begins with the question of why, as nations rise in wealth, their citizens become no happier, and he considers the possibility that once basic needs are met,",488
Page 114,"The Pursuit ofHappiness 99 money simply cannot buy additional happiness. After a careful review of the evidence, however, Frank concludes that those who think money can’t buy happiness just don't know where to shop. Some purchases are much less subject to the adaptation principle. Frank wants to know why people are so devoted to spending money on luxuries and other goods, to which they adapt completely, rather than on things that would make them last­ ingly happier. For example, people would be happier and healthier if they took more time off and “spent”it with their family and friends, yetAmerica has long been heading in the opposite direction. People would be happier if they reduced their commuting time, even if it meant living in smaller houses, yet American trends are toward ever larger houses and ever longer commutes. People would be happier and healthier if they took longer vaca­ tions, even if that meant earning less, yet vacation times are shrinking in the United States, and in Europe as well. People would be happier, and in the long run wealthier, if they bought basic, functional appliances, auto­ mobiles, and wristwatches, and invested the money they saved for future consumption; yet, Americans in particular spend almost everything they have—and sometimes more—on goods for present consumption, often pay­ ing a large premium for designer names and superfluous features. Franks explanation is simple: Conspicuous and inconspicuous consump­ tion follow different psychological rules. Conspicuous consumption refers to things that arevisible to others and that are taken as markers of a persons relative success. These goods are subject to a kind of arms race, where their value comes not so much from their objective properties as from the state­ ment they make about their owner. When everyone wore Timex watches, the first person in the office buy a Rolex stood out. When everyone moved up to Rolex, it took a $20,000 Patek Philip to achieve high status, and a Rolex no longer gave as much satisfaction. Conspicuous consumption is a zero-sum game: Each persons move up devalues the possessions of oth­ ers. Furthermore, its difficult to persuade an entire group or subculture to ratchet down, even though everyone would be better off, on average, if they all went back to simple watches. Inconspicuous consumption, on the other hand, refers to goods and activities that are valued for themselves, that are usually consumed more privately, and that are not bought for the purpose of",521
Page 115,"100 T h e H a p p i n eHsy p o t h e s i s achieving status. Because Americans, at least, gain no prestige from taking the longest vacations or having the shortest commutes, these inconspicuous consumables are not subject to an arms race. Just try this thought experiment. Which job would you rather have: one in which you earned $90,000 a year and your coworkers earned on average $70,000, or one in which you earned $100,000 but your coworkers earned on average $150,000? Many people choose the first job, thereby revealing that relative position is worth at least $10,000 to them. Now try this one: Would you rather work for a company that gave you two weeks of vacation ayear, but other employees were given, on average, only one; or would you prefer a company that gave you four weeks of vacation a year, but other employees were given, on average, six? The great majority of people choose the longer absolute time .56Time off is inconspicuous consumption, al­ though people can easily turn a vacation into conspicuous consumption by spending vast amounts of money to impress others instead of using the time to rejuvenate themselves. Franks conclusions are bolstered by recent research on the benefits of “doingversus having.”The psychologists Leaf van Boven and Tom Gilovich asked people to think back to a time when they spent more than a hundred dollars with the intention of increasing their happiness and enjoyment. One group of subjects was asked to pick a material possession; the other was asked to pick an experience or activity they had paid for. After describ­ ing their purchases, subjects were asked to fill out a questionnaire. Those who described buying an experience (such as a ski trip, a concert, or a great meal) were happier when thinking about their purchase, and thought that their money was better spent, than those who described buying a ma­ terial object (such as clothing, jewelry, or electroni) .5After conducting several variations of this experiment with similar findings each time, Van Boven and Gilovich concluded that experiences give more happiness in part because they have greater social value: Most activities that cost more than a hundred dollars are things we do with other people, but expensive material possessions are often purchased in part to impress pther people. Activities connect us to others; objects often separate us. Sonowyou know where to shop. Stop trying to keep up with the Joneses. Stop wastingyour money on conspicuous consumption. As a first step, work",526

The Chinese sage Lao Tzu warned people to make their own choices and not pursue the material objects everyone else was pursuing: Racing and hunting madden the mind. Precious things lead one astray. Therefore the sage is guided bywhat he feels and not bywhat he sees. He lets go of that and chooses thi.58 Unfortunately, letting go of one thing and choosing another is difficult if the elephant wraps his trunk around the “precious thing” and refuses to let go. The elephant was shaped by natural selection to win at the game of life, and part of its strategyis to impress others, gain their admiration, and rise in relative rank. The elephant caresabout prestige ,not happiness 59 and it looks eternally to others to figure out what is prestigious. The elephant will pur­ sue its evolutionary goals even when greater happiness can be found else­ where. If everyone is chasing the same limited amount of prestige, then all are stuck in a zero-sum game, an eternal arms race, a world in which rising wealth does not bring rising happiness. The pursuit of luxury goods is a hap­ piness trap; it is a dead end that people race toward in the mistaken belief that it will make them happy Modern life has many other traps. Heres some bait. Of the following words, pick the one that is most appealing to you: constraint, limit, barrier; choice. Odds areyou chose choice, because the first three gave you a flash of negative affect (remember the like-o-meter). Choice and its frequent associ­ ate freedom are unquestioned goods of modern life. Most people would rather shop at a supermarket that stocks ten items in each food categorythan at a small store that stocksjust two. Most people would prefer to invest their retirement savings through a company that offers forty funds than one that offers four. Yet, when people are actually given a larger array of choices—for example, an assortment of thirty (rather than six) gourmet chocolates from which to choose—they are less likely to make a choice; and if they do, they are less satisfied with .60The more choices there are, the more you expect to find aperfect fit; yet, at the same time, the larger the array, the less likelyit",489
Page 117,"102 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s becomes that you picked the best item. You leave the store less confident in your choice, more likely to feel regret, and more likely to think about the op­ tions you didn't choose. If you can avoid making a choice, you are more likely to do so. The psychologist Barry Schwartz calls this the “paradox of choice”:61 We value choice and put ourselves in situations of choice, even though choice often undercuts our happiness. But Schwartz and his colleagues 62 find that the paradox mostly applies to people they call “maximizers”—those who habitually tryto evaluate all the options, seekout more information, and make the best choice (or “maximize their utility,” as economists would say). Other people—“satisficers”—are more laid back about choice. Theyevaluate an array of options until they find one that is good enough, and then they stop looking. Satisficers are not hurt by a surfeit of options. Maximizers end up making slightlybetter decisions than satisficers, on average (all that worry and information-gatheringdoes help), but theyare less happywith their deci­ sions, and theyare more inclined to depression and anxiety. In one clever study,63maximizers and satisficers were asked to solve ana­ grams while sitting next to another subject (really a co-experimenter) who was solving them either much faster or much slower. Satisficers were rela­ tivelyunfazed by the experience. Their ratings of their own ability, and ofhow much they enjoyed the study, were barely affected by what the other subject did. But maximizers were thrown for a loop when the other subject was faster than they were. They later reported lower estimates of their own abilities and higher levels of negative emotions. (Being paired with a slower peer didn't have much effect—another instance of negative events being stronger than positive). The point here is that maximizers engage in more social compari­ son, and are therefore more easily drawn into conspicuous consumption. Paradoxically, maximizers get less pleasure per dollar they spend. Modern life is full of traps. Some of these traps are set by marketers and advertisers who knowjust what the elephant wants—and it isn't happiness. T h e H a p p i n e s sH y p o t h e s i sR e c o n s i d e r e d When I began writing this book, I thought that Buddha would be a strong contender for the “Best Psychologist of the Last Three Thousand Years”",545
Page 118,"The Pursuit of Happiness 103 award. Tome, his diagnosis of the futility of strivingfelt so right, his promise of tranquility so alluring. But in doing research for the book, I began to think that Buddhism might be based on an overreaction, perhaps even an error. According to legend ,64Buddha was the son of a king in northern India. When he was bom (as Siddhartha Gautama), the king heard a prophecy that his son was destined to leave, to go into the forest and turn his back on the kingdom. So as the boy grewinto adulthood, his father tried to tie him down with sensual pleasures and hide from him anything that might disturb his mind. The young prince was married to a beautiful princess and raised on the upper floors of the palace, surrounded by a harem of other beautiful women. But he grew bored (the adaptation principle) and curious about the world outside. Eventually, he prevailed upon his father to let him go for a chariot ride. On the morning of the ride, the king ordered that all people who were old, sick, or crippled were to retreat indoors. Yet one old man remained on the road, and the prince saw him. The prince asked his chariot driver to explain the odd-lookingcreature, and the driver told him that everyone grows old. Stunned, the young prince returned to his palace. On the next days ex­ cursion, he saw a sick man, his body hobbled by disease. More explanation, more retreating to the palace. On the third day, the prince saw a corpse be­ ing carried through the streets. This was the last straw. Upon discovering that old age, disease, and deathare the destinyof all people, the prince cried, “Turn back the chariot! This is no time orplace for pleasure excursions. How could an intelligent person pay no heed at a time of disaster, when he knows of his impending destruction ? ”65The prince then left his wife, his harem, and, as prophesied, his royal future. He went into the forest and began his journey to enlightenment. After his enlightenment, Buddha 66 (the “awak­ ened one”) preached that life is suffering, and that the only way to escape this suffering is by breaking the attachments that bind us to pleasure, achievement, reputation, and life. But what would have happened if the young prince had actually de­ scended from his gilded chariot and talked to the people he assumed were so miserable? What if he had interviewed the poor, the elderly, the crippled, and the sick? One of the most adventurous young psychologists, Robert Uiswas-Diener (son of the happiness pioneer Ed Diener), has done just that. He has traveled the world interviewing people about their lives and",580
Page 119,"104 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s how satisfied they are with them. Wherever he goes, from Greenland to Kenya to California, he finds that most people (with the exception of home­ less people) are more satisfied than dissatisfied with their lives.67He even interviewed sex workers in the slums of Calcutta, forced by poverty to sell their bodies and sacrifice their futures to disease. Although these women were substantially less satisfied with their lives than was a comparison group of college students in Calcutta, they still (on average) rated their sat­ isfaction with each of twelve specific aspects of their lives as more satisfied than dissatisfied, or else as neutral (rfeither satisfied nor dissatisfied). Yes, they suffered privations that seem to us in the West unbearable, but they also had close friends with whom they spent much of their time, and most of them stayed in touch with their families. Biswas-Diener concludes that “while the poor of Calcutta do not lead enviable lives, they do lead mean­ ingful lives. They capitalize on the non-material resources available to them and find satisfaction in many areas of their lives.”68Like quadriplegics, the elderly, or any other class of people the young Buddha might have pitied, the lives of these prostitutes are much better from the inside than they seem from the outside. Another reason for Buddhas emphasis on detachment may have been the turbulent times he lived in: Kings and city-states were making war, and peoples lives and fortunes could be burned up overnight. When life is unpre­ dictable and dangerous (as it was for the Stoic philosophers, living under capricious Roman emperors), it might be foolish to seekhappiness by control­ ling ones external world. But now it is not. People living in wealthy democra­ cies can set long-term goals and expect to meet them. We are immunized against disease, shelteredfrom storms, and insured against fire, theft, and col­ lision. For the first time in human history, most people (in wealthy countries) will live past the age of seventy and will not see any of their children die be­ fore them. Although all of us will get unwanted surprises along the way, well adapt and cope with nearly all of them, and many of us will believe we are better off for having suffered. So to cut off all attachments, to shun the plea­ sures of sensuality and triumph in an effort to escape the pains of loss and defeat—this now strikes me as an inappropriate response to the inevitable presence ofsome suffering in everylife.",555
Page 120,"The Pursuit ofHappiness 105 Many Western thinkers have looked at the same afflictions as Buddha— sickness, aging, and mortality—and come to avery different conclusion from his: Through passionate attachments topeople, goals, and pleasures, life must be lived to the fullest. I once heard a talkby the philosopher Robert Solomon, who directlychallenged the philosophyofnonattachment as an affront to hu­ man nature .69The life of cerebral reflection and emotional indifference (ap- atheia) advocated by many Greek and Roman philosophers and that of calm nonstriving advocated by Buddha are lives designed to avoid passion, and a life without passion is not a human life. Yes, attachments bring pain, but they also bring our greatest joys, and there is value in the very variation that the philosophers are trying to avoid. I was stunned to hear a philosopher reject so much of ancient philosophy, but I was also inspired in a way that I had never been as an undergraduate student of philosophy I walked out of the lecture hall feeling that I wanted to do something then and there to embrace life. Solomons message was unorthodox in philosophy, but it is common in the work of romantic poets, novelists, and nature writers: “We do not live but a quarter part of our life—why do we not let on the flood—raise the gates— & set our wheels in motion—He that hath ears to hear let him hear. Employ your senses.” ( He n rDya v Tdh o r e,1851)70 Even a future justice of the U.S. Supreme Court—a body devoted to reason—issued this opinion: “I think that, as life is action and passion, it is required of a man that he should share the passion and action of his time at peril of being judged not to have lived.” ( Ol i v eWre n d e l H o l m e , r ., 18 8 4 )71 Buddha, Lao Tzu, and other sages of the East discovered a path to peace and tranquility, the path of letting go. They told us how to follow the path us­ ing meditation and stillness. Millions of people in the West have followed, and although few, if any, have reached Nirvana, many have found some de­ gree of peace, happiness, and spiritual growth. So I do not mean to question the value or relevance of Buddhism in the modern world, or the importance of working on yourself in an effort to find happiness. Rather, I would like to suggest that the happiness hypothesis be extended—for now—into a yin- yang formulation: Happiness comesfrom within, and happiness comesfrom without. (In chapter 1 0, IT1suggest a further refinement of the hypothesis.)",574

Page 123,"108 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s My father had the bad luck to be born at the confluence point of three big ideas. The first was germ theory, proposed in the 1840s by Ignaz Sem- melweis and incorporated into hospitals and homes with gradually increas­ ing ferocityover the next century. When theybegan to collect statistics from orphanages and foundling homes in the 1920s, pediatricians came to fear germs above all else. As far back as records went, they showed that most children dropped off at foundling homes died within one year. In 1915, a New Yorkphysician, Henry Chapin, reported to the American Pediatric So­ ciety that out of the ten foundling homes he had examined, in all but one of them all the children had died before their second birthday .3As pediatri­ cians came to grips with the deadly effects of institutions on young chil­ dren, they reacted in a logical way by launching a crusade against germs. It became a priority in orphanages and hospitals to isolate children as much as possible in clean cubicles to prevent them from infecting each other. Beds were separated, dividers were placed between beds, nurses retreated be­ hind masks and gloves, and mothers were scolded for violating quarantine. The other two big ideas were psychoanalysis and behaviorism. These two theories agreed on very little, but they both agreed that the infants attach­ ment to its mother is based on milk. Freud thought that the infants libido (desire for pleasure) is first satisfied by the breast, and therefore the infant develops its first attachment (psychological need) to the breast. Only gradu­ ally does the child generalize that desire to the woman who owns the breast. The behaviorists didn’t care about libido, but they, too, saw the breast as the first reinforcer, the first reward (milk) for the first behavior (sucking). The heart ofbehaviorism, if it had one, was conditioning—the idea that learning occurs when rewards are conditional upon behaviors. Unconditional love— holding, nuzzling, and cuddling children for no reason—was seen as the surest way to make children lazy, spoiled, and weak. Freudians and behav­ iorists were united in their belief that highly affectionate mothering dam­ ages children, and that scientific principles could improve child rearing. Three years before my father entered the hospital, John Watson, the leading American behaviorist (in the years before B. F. Skinner), published the best-seller Psychological Care of Infant and Child.4Watson wrote of his dream that one day babies would be raised in baby farms, away from the corrupting influences of parents. But until that day arrived, parents were",589
Page 124,"Love andAttachments 109 urged to use behaviorist techniques to rear strong children: Dont pick them up when they cry, dont cuddle or coddle them, just dole out benefits and punishments for each good and bad action. How could science have gotten it so wrong? How could doctors and psy­ chologists not have seen that children need love as well as milk? This chap­ ter is about that need—the need for other people, for touch, and for close relationships. No man, woman, or child is an island. Scientists have come a long way since John Watson, and there is now a much more humane sci­ ence of love. The storyof this science begins with orphans and rhesus mon­ keys and ends with a challenge to the dismal view of love held by many of the ancients, East and West. The heroes of this stpry are two psychologists who rejected the central tenets of their training: Harry Harlow and John Bowlby. These two men knew that something was missing in behaviorism and in psychoanalysis, respectively. Against great odds they changed their fields, they humanized the treatment of children, and they made it possible for science to greatly improve upon the wisdom of the ancients. To H a v e a n d t o H o l d Harry Harlow 5 earned his Ph.D. in 1930 at Stanford, where he wrote his dissertation on the feeding behavior of baby rats. He took ajob at the Uni­ versity of Wisconsin, where he found himself overwhelmed with teaching and undersupplied with research subjects—he had no lab space, no rats, no way to perform the experiments he was expected to publish. Out of des­ peration, Harlow took his students to the little zoo in Madison, Wisconsin, which had a small number of primates. Harlow and his first graduate stu­ dent, Abe Maslow, couldnt run controlled experiments using so few ani­ mals. They were forced instead to observe, to keep their minds open, and to learn from species closely related to human beings. And one of the first things they saw was curiosity. The apes and monkeys liked to solve puzzles (the humans gave them tests to measure physical dexterity and intelli­ gence), and would work at tasks for what seemed to be the sheer pleasure of it. Behaviorism, in contrast, said that animals will only do what they have been reinforced for doing.",504
Page 125,"110 T h e Ha p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s Harlow sensed he had found a flaw in behaviorism, but he couldn't prove it with anecdotes from the local zoo. He desperately wanted a lab in which to study primates, not rats, sohe built one himself—literally built it, in the shell of an abandoned building, with the help of his students. In that makeshift lab, for the'next thirty years, Harlow and his students infuriated behaviorists by demonstrating with ever more precision that monkeys are curious, intelligent creatures who like to figure things out. They follow the laws ofreinforcement to some degree, as do humans, but there is much more going on in a monkey brain than the brain of a behaviorist could grasp. For example, giving monkeys raisins as a reward for each correct step in solving a puzzle (such as opening a mechanical latch with several moving parts) actually interferes with the solving, because it distracts the monkeys .6They enjoy the task for its own sake. As Harlows lab grew, he faced perennial shortages of monkeys. They were hard to import and, when they arrived they were often sick, bringing a stream of new infections into the lab. In 1955, Harlow conceived the bold idea of starting his own breeding colony of rhesus monkeys. Nobody had ever created a self-sustaining breeding colony of monkeys in the United States, let alone in the cold climate of Wisconsin, but Harlow was un­ deterred. He allowed his rhesus monkeys to mate, and then he took away the children within hours of their birth— to save them from infections in the crowded lab. After much experimentation, he and his students created an artificial baby formula full of nutrients and antibiotics. They found the optimum pattern of feeding, light and dark cycles, and temperature. Each baby was raised in its own cage, safe from disease. Harlow had in a way re­ alized Watsons dream of a baby farm, and the crop grew large and healthy- looking. But when the farm-raised monkeys were brought into the company of others, they were stunned and unnerved. They never developed normal social or problem-solving skills, so they were useless for experiments. Har­ low and his students were stumped. What had they forgotten? The clue was in plain sight, clutched in the monkeys' hands, until finally a grad student, Bill Mason, noticed it: diapers. The cages in the baby hatchery were sometimes lined with old diapers to provide bedding mate­ rial and protect the babies from the cold floor. The monkeys clung to the diapers, especially when they were afraid, and took them along when they",562
Page 126,"Love andAttachments 111 were carried to new cages. Mason proposed a test to Harlow: Lets expose some young monkeys to a bundle of cloth and a bundle of wood. Let s see whether the monkeys just need to hold on to something, anything, or whether theres something special about the softness of the cloth. Harlow loved the idea, and, as he thought it over, he sawan even grander question: Were the diapers really substitutes for mothers? Did the monkeys have an innate need to hold and be held, a need that was utterly starved in the baby farm? If so, how could he prove it? Harlows proof became one of the most famous experiments in all of psychology. Harlow put the milk hypothesis to a direct test. He created two kinds of surrogate mother, each one a cylinder about the size of an adult female rhe­ sus monkey, complete with a wooden head that had eyes and a mouth. One kind was made ofwire mesh, the other was covered with a layer of foam and then a layer of soft terrycloth. Each of eight baby rhesus monkeys was raised alone in a cage with two surrogate mothers, one of each kind. For four of the monkeys, milk was delivered only from a tube coming through the chest of the wire mother. For the other four, the tube came through the chest of the cloth mother. If Freud and Watson were right that milk was the cause of attachment, the monkeys should attach to their milk givers. But that's not what happened. All the monkeys spent nearly all their time clinging to, climbing on, and pushing themselves into the soft folds of the cloth mother. Harlow's experiment 7 is so elegant and so convincing that you don’t need to see statistics to understand the results. You just need to see the famous photo, now included in every introductory psychology book, in which a baby monkey clings to the cloth mother with its hind legs while stretching over to feed from the tube protruding from the wire mother. Harlow argued that “contact comfort'' is a basic need that young mam­ mals have for physical contact with their mother. In the absence of a real mother, young mammals will seek out whatever feels most like a mother. Ilarlow chose the term carefully, because the mother, even a cloth mother, provides comfort when it is most needed, and that comfort comes mostly from direct contact. Displays of familial love often move people to tears, and Deborah Blum’s wonderful biography of Harlow, Love at Goon Park,8is full of touching ex­ pressions of familial love. It is an uplifting story, ultimately, but along the",544

The cover of the book, for ex­ ample, shows a picture of a young rhesus monkey alone in a cage, gazing at its cloth “mother”through a pane of glass. L q v e C o n q u e r s F e a r John Bowlby’s life followed an entirely different path from Harlows, even though it led, ultimately, to the same discovery .9Bowlby was an English aristocrat, raised by a nanny, and sent to boarding school. He studied med­ icine and became a psychoanalyst, but during his early training years, he did some volunteer work that shaped the rest of his career. He worked at two homes for maladjusted children, many of whom had no real contact with their parents. Some were aloof and uncommunicative; others were hopelessly clingy, following him around anxiously if he paid the slightest attention to them. After serving in World War II, Bowlby returned to En­ gland to run the childrens clinic in a hospital. He began to do research on how separation from parents affects children. Europe at that time had just experienced more parent-child separations than had any place in all of hu­ man history. The war had created vast numbers of orphans, refugees, and children sent away to the countryside for their own safety. The new World Health Organization commissioned Bowlby to write a report on the best way to deal with these children. Bowlby toured hospitals and orphanages, and his report, published in 1951, was a passionate argument against pre­ vailing notions that separation and isolation are harmless, and that biologi­ cal needs such as nutrition are paramount. Children need love to develop properly, he argued; children need mothers. Throughout the 1950s, Bowlby developed his ideas and weathered the scorn of psychoanalysts such as Anna Freud and Melanie Klein, whose theories (about libido and breasts) he contradicted. He had the good luck to meet a leading ethologist of the day, Robert Hinde, who taught him about new research on animal behavior. Konrad Lorenz, for example, had demonstrated that ducklings, ten to twelve hours after they hatch, will lock onto whatever duck-sized thing moves around in their environment and theft follow it around for months.10In nature this thing is always mom, but",516
Page 128,"Love andAttachments 113 in Lorenzs demonstrations, anything he moved around worked— even his own boots (with him in them). This visual “imprinting”mechanism is quite different from what happens in people, but once Bowlby began to think about how evolution creates mechanisms to make sure that mothers and children stay together, the way was open for an entirely new approach to human parent-child relationships. Theres no need to derive the bond from milk, reinforcement, libido, or anything else. Rather, the attachment of mother and child is so enormously important for the survival of the child that a dedicated system is built into mother and child in all species that relyon maternal care. As Bowlby began to pay more attention to animal be­ havior, he saw many similarities between the behaviors of baby monkeys and baby humans: clinging, sucking, crying when left behind, following whenever possible. All these behaviors functioned in other primates to keep the child close to mom, and all were visible in human children, even the “pick me up”signal of upstretched arms. In 1957, Hinde learned about Harlows not-yet-published cloth-mother studies and told Bowlby, who wrote to Harlow and later visited him in Wis­ consin. The two men became great allies and supporters of each other. Bowlby, the great theorist, created the framework that has unified most sub- sequent research on parent-child relations; and Harlow, the great experi­ mentalist, provided the first irrefutable lab demonstrations of the theory. Bowlbys grand synthesis is called attachment theory .11It borrows from the science of cybernetics—the study of how mechanical and biological systems can regulate themselves to achieve preset goals while the environ­ ment around and inside them changes. Bowlby’s first metaphor was the simplest cybernetic system of all—a thermostat that turns on a heater when the temperature drops below a set point. Attachment theory begins with the idea that two basic goals guide chil­ dren’s behavior: safety and exploration. A child who stays safe survives; a child who explores and plays develops the skills and intelligence needed for adult life. (This is why all mammal babies play; and the larger their frontal cortex, the more they need to play ) .1These two needs are often opposed, however, sotheyare regulated bya kind of thermostat that monitors the level of ambient safety. When the safety level is adequate, the child plays and ex­ plores. But as soon as it drops too low, it’s as though a switch were thrown",532
Page 129,"114 T h e Ha p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s and suddenly safety needs become paramount. The child stops playing and moves toward mom. If mom is unreachable, the child cries, and with in­ creasing desperation; when mom returns, the child seeks touch, or some other reassurance, before the system can reset and play can resume. This is an instance of the “design”principle I discussed in chapter 2: opposing sys­ tems push against each other to reach a balance point. (Fathers make per­ fectly good attachment figures, but Bowlby focused on mother-child attachments, which usuallyget off to a faster start.) If you want to see the system in action, just try engaging a two-year-old in play If you go to a friends house and meet her child for the first time, it should take only a minute. The child feels secure in his familiar surround­ ings, and his mother functions as what Bowlby called a “secure base”—an attachment figure whose presence guarantees safety, turns off fear, and thereby enables the\explorations that lead to healthy development. But if your friend brings her son over to your house for the first time, it will take longer. You’ll probably have to walk around your friendjust to find the little head hiding behind her thighs. And then, if you succeed in starting a game—making faces at him to make him laugh, perhaps—just watch what happens when his mother goes to the kitchen to get a glass of water. The thermostat clicks, the game ends, and your play partner scampers off to the kitchen, too. Harlow had shown all the same behavior in monkeys .13 Young monkeys placed with their cloth mother in the center of an open room full of toys eventually climbed down from mom to explore, but they returned often to touch her and reconnect. If the cloth mother was re­ moved from the room, all play stopped and frantic screaming ensued. ,When children are separated from their attachment figures for a long time, as in a hospital stay, they quickly descend into passivity and despair. When theyare denied a stable and enduring attachment relationship (raised, for example, bya succession offoster parents or nurses), they are likely tobe damaged for life, Bowlby said. They might become the aloof loners or hope­ less clingers that Bowlby had seen in his volunteer work. Bowlby’stheory di­ rectlycontradictedWatson aswell as the Freuds (Sigmund and Anna): If you want your children to grow up to be healthy and independent, you should hold them, hug them, cuddle them, and love them. Give them a secure base and theywill explore and then conquer the world on their own. The power of",580
Page 130,"Love andAttachments 115 love over fear was well expressed in the New Testament: “There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear”(Jo h 4:18). T h e P r o o f Is i n t h e P a r t i n g If youre going to contradict the prevailing wisdom of your day, you’d better have darn good evidence. Harlows studies were darn good, but skeptics claimed they didn’t apply to people, Bowlby needed more proof, and he got it from a Canadian woman who happened to answer an ad he placed for a research assistant in 1950. Mary Ainsworth, who had moved to London with her husband, spent three years working with Bowlby on his early stud­ ies of hospitalized children. When her husband took an academic job in Uganda, Ainsworth went with him again and took advantage of the oppor­ tunity to make careful observations of children in Ugandan villages. Even in a culture where women share mothering duties for all the children in the extended family household, Ainsworth observed a special bond be­ tween a child and his own mother. The mother was much more effective as a secure base than were other women. Ainsworth then moved to the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and after that to the University of Vir­ ginia, where she thought about how to test Bowlby’s ideas, and her own, about the mother-child relationship. In Bowlby’scybernetic theory, the action is in the changes. You can’tjust watch a child play; you have to look at how the exploration and safety goals shift in response to changing conditions. So Ainsworth developed a little drama, later called the “Strange Situation,” and cast the child in the star­ ring role. 1In essence, she re-created the experiments in which Harlow had placed monkeys in an open room with novel toys. In the first scene, the mother and her child enter a comfortable room, full of toys. Most chil­ dren in the experiment soon crawl or toddle off to explore. In scene two, a Friendly woman enters, talks with the mother for a few minutes, and then joins the child in play. In scene three, the mother gets up and leaves the child alone for a few minutes with the stranger. In scene four, she returns and the stranger leaves. In scene five, the mother leaves again, and the child is all alone in the room. In scene six, the stranger returns; and in",523
Page 131,"116 T h e H a p p i n eHsy p o t h e s i s scene seven, the mother returns for good. The play is designed to ratchet up the child’s stress level in order to see how the child’sattachment system manages the scene changes. Ainsworth found three common patterns of managing. In about two-thirds of American children, the system does just what Bowlby said it should, that is, shift smoothly between play and security- seekingas the situation changes. Children following this pattern, called “se­ cure” attachment, reduce or stop their play when their mothers leave, and then show anxiety, which the stranger cannot fully relieve. In the two scenes where mom returns, these children show delight, often moving to­ ward her or touching her to reestablish contact with their secure base; but then they quickly settle down and return to play In the other third of chil­ dren, the scene changes are more awkward; these children have one of two types of insecure attachment. The majority of them don’t seem to care very much whether mom comes or goes, although subsequent physiological re­ search showed that they are indeed distressed by the separation. Rather, these children seem to be suppressing their distress by trying to manage it on their own instead of relyingupon mom for comfort. Ainsworth called this pattern “avoidant”attachment. The remaining children, about 1 2percent in the United States, are anxious and clingy throughout the study. They be­ come extremely upset when separated from mom, they sometimes resist her efforts to comfort them when she returns, and they never fully settle down to play in the unfamiliar room. Ainsworth called this pattern “resistan.”15 Ainsworth first thought these differences were caused entirely by good or bad mothering. She observed mothers at home and found that those who were warm and highly responsive to their children were most likely to have children who showed secure attachment in the strange situation. These chil­ dren had learned that they could count on their mothers, and were therefore the most bold and confident. Mothers who were aloofand unresponsive were more likely to have avoidant children, who had learned not to expect much help and comfort from mom. Mothers whose responses were erratic and un­ predictable were more likely to have resistant children, who had learned that their efforts to elicit comfort sometimes paid off, but sometimes not. But whenever I hear about correlations between mother and child, I’m skeptical. Twin studies almost always show that personality traits are due",519
Page 132,"Love andAttachments 117 more to genetics than to parenting .16Maybe its just that happy women, those who won the cortical lottery, are warm and loving, and they pass on their happy genes to their children, who then show up as securely attached. Or maybe the correlation runs in reverse: Children do have stable inborn temperaments 1—sunny, cranky, or anxious—and the sunny ones arejust so much fun that their mothers want to be more responsive. My skepticism is bolstered by the fact that studies done after Ainsworths home study have generally found only small correlations between mothers’ responsiveness andjhe attachment style of their children .18On the other hand, twin stud­ ies have found that genes play only a small role in determining attachment style. 1So now we have a real puzzle, a trait that correlates weakly with mothering and weaklywith genes. Where does it come from? Bowlby’s cybernetic theory forces us to think outside the usual nature- nurture dichotomy. You have to see attachment style as a property that emerges gradually during thousands of interactions. A child with a particular (genetically influenced) temperament makes bids for protection. A mother with a particular (genetically influenced) temperament responds, or doesn’t respond, based on her mood, on how overworked she is, or on what childcare guru she has been reading. No one event is particularly important, but over lime the child builds up what Bowlby called an “internal working model” of himself, his mother, and their relationship. If the model says that mom is al­ ways there foryou, you’ll be bolder in your playand explorations. Round after round, predictable and reciprocal interactions build trust and strengthen the relationship. Children with sunny dispositions who have happy mothers are almost certain to play the game well and develop a secure attachment style, but a dedicated mother can overcome either her own or her child’s less pleasant disposition and foster a secure internal working model of their rela- Iionship. (Everything I have reported above is true for fathers too, but most children in all cultures spend more time with their mothers.) I t's N o t Ju s t f o r C h i l d r e n When I started writing this chapter, I planned to review attachment theory in a page or two and then move on to the stuff that we adults really care",492
Page 133,"118 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s about. When we hear the word “love,”we think of romantic love. We might hear an occasional song about love between parents and children on a country music radio station, but anywhere else on the dial love means the kind of love you fall into and then struggle to hold onto. The more I delved into the research, however, the more I realized that Harlow, Bowlby, and Ainsworth can help us understand grown-up love. See for yourself. Which of the following statements best describes you in romantic relationships? 1. I find it relatively easy to get close to others and am comfortable depending on them and having them depend on me. I dont often worry about being abandoned or about someone getting too close to me. 2. I am somewhat uncomfortable being close to others; I find it diffi­ cult to trust them completely, difficult to allow myself to depend on them. I am nervous when anyone gets too close, and often lovepart­ ners want me to be more intimate than I feel comfortable being 3. I find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like. I of­ ten worry that my partner doesn’t really love me or won’t want to stay with me. I want to merge completely with another person, and this desire sometimes scares people away .20 The attachment researchers Cindy Hazan and Phil Shaver developed this simple test to see whether Ainsworth’s three styles were still at work when adults try to form relationships. They are. Some people change style as they grow up, but the great majority of adults choose the descriptor that matched the way they were as a child .21 (The three choices above corre­ spond to Ainsworth’s secure, avoidant, and resistant patterns.) Internal working models are fairly stable (though not unchangeable), guiding people in their most important relationships throughout their lives. And just as secure babies are happier and more well-adjusted, secure adults en­ joy happier, longer relationships as well as lower rates of divorc.22 But does adult romantic love really grow out of the same psychological systemthat attaches children to their mothers? Tofind out, Hazan traced the process bywhich childhood attachment changes with age. Bowlby had been specific about the four defining features of attachment relationships:23",490
Page 134,"Love andAttachments 119 1. proximity maintenance (the child wants and strives to be near the parent) 2. separation distress (self-explanatory) 3. safe haven (the child, when frightened or distressed, comes to the parent for comfort) 4. secure base (the child uses the parent as a base from which to launch exploration and personal growth) Hazan and her colleagues 24 surveyed hundreds of people from the ages of six through eighty-two, asking which people in their lives fulfilled each of the four defining features of attachment (for example: “Whom do you most like to spend time with?”“Whom do you turn to when you are feeling upset?”). If babies could take the survey, they would nominate mom or dad as the answer to all questions, but by the time they are eight, children want most strongly to spend time with their peers. (When children resist leaving their friends to come home for dinner, that’s proximity maintenance.) Be­ tween the ages of eight and fourteen, safe haven expands from parents to include peers as adolescents begin turning to each other for emotional sup­ port. But it’sonly at the end of adolescence, around the ages fifteen to sev­ enteen, that all four components of attachment can be satisfied by a peer, specifically a romantic partner. The New Testament records this normal transference of attachment: “For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. So they are no longer two, but one flesh” ( Ma r k1 0 :7 - 9 ). Evidence that romantic partners become true attachment figures, like parents, comes from a review25, of research on how people cope with the death of a spouse, or a long separation. The review found that adults experi­ ence the same sequence Bowlby had observed in children placed in hospi­ tals: initial anxiety and panic, followed by lethargy and depressionrfollowed by recovery through emotional detachment. Furthermore, the review found that contact with close friends was of little help in blunting the pain, but re­ newed contact with one’sparents was much more effective. Once you think about it, the similarities between romantic relationships and parent-infant relationships are obvious. Lovers in the first rush of love spend endless hours in face-to-facemutual gaze, holding each-other, nuzzling",500
Page 135,"120 T h e H a p p i n eHsy p o t h e s i s and cuddling, kissing, using babyvoices, and enjoying the same release of the hormone oxytocin that binds mothers and babies to each other in a kind of addiction. Oxytocin prepares female mammals to give birth (triggering uter­ ine contractions and milk release), but it also affects their brains, fostering nurturant behaviors and reducing feelings of stresswhen mothers are in con­ tact with their childre.26 This powerful attachment of mothers to infants—often called the “care- giving system”—is a different psychological system from the attachment system in infants, but the two systems obviously evolved in tandem. The infants distress signals are effective only because they trigger caregiving desires in the mother. Oxytocin is the glue that makes the two parts stick together. Oxytocin has been oversimplified in the popular press as a hor­ mone that makes people (even ornery men) suddenly sweet and affection­ ate, but more recent work suggests that it can also be thought ofas a stress hormone in women :27It is secreted when women are under stress and their attachment needs are not being met, causing a need for contact with a loved one. On the other hand, when oxytocin floods the brain (male or female) while two people are in skin-to-skin contact, the effect is soothing and calming, and it strengthens the bond between them. For adults, the biggest rush of oxytocin—other than giving birth and nursing—comes from sex.28Sexual activity, especially if it includes cuddling, extended touching, and orgasm, turns on many of the same circuits that are used to bond in­ fants and parents. Its no wonder that childhood attachment styles persist in adulthood: The whole attachment system persists. L o v e a n d t h e S w e l l e d H e a d Adult love relationships are therefore built out of two ancient and interlock­ ing systems: an attachment system that bonds child to mother and a care- giving system that bonds mother to child. These systems are as old as mammals—older perhaps, because birds have them, too. But we still have to add something else to explain why sexis related to love. No problem; nature was motivating animals to seek each other outfor sexlong before mammals or birds existed. The “mating system” is completely separate from the other",510
Page 136,"Love andAttachments 121 two systems, and it involves distinctive brain areas and hormones .29In some animals, such as rats, the mating system draws male and female togetherjust long enough for them to copulate. In other species, such as elephants, male and female are drawn together for several days—the duration of the fertile period—during which they share tender caresses, play joyfully, and show many other signs that remind human observers of mutual infatuation .30 Whatever the duration, for most mammals (other than humans) the three sys­ tems are strung together with perfect predictability. First, hormonal changes in the female around the time ofovulation trigger advertisements of her fertil­ ity: Female dogs and cats, for example, release pheromones; female chim­ panzees and bonobos exhibit enormous red genital swellings. Next, the males become turned on and compete (in some species) to see who gets to mate. ’he female makes some sort of choice (in most species), which in turn acti­ vates herown mating system; and then, some months later, birth activates the earegiving systemin the mother and the attachment system in the,child. Dad is left out in the cold, where he spends his time sniffing for more phero­ mones, or scanning for more swellings. Sex is for reproduction; lasting love is for mothers and children. So why arepeople so different? How did human fe­ males come to hide all signs ofovulation and get men to fall in love with them and their children? Nobody knows, but the most plausible theory 31in my opinion begins with the enormous expansion of the human brain that I talked about in chapters 1 and 3. When the first hominids split off from the ancestors of modern chimpanzees, their brains were no bigger than those of chim­ panzees. These human ancestors were basicallyjust bipedal apes. But then, around 3 million years ago, something changed. Something in the environ­ ment, or perhaps an increase in tool use made possible by increasingly dex­ trous hands, made it highly adaptive to have a much larger brain and much higher intelligence. However, brain growth faced a literal bottleneck: the birth canal. There were physical limits to how large a head hominid females could give birth to and still have a pelvis that would allow them to walk up­ right. At least one species of hominid—our ancestor—evolved a novel tech­ nicjue that got around this limitation by sending babies out of the uterus long before their brains were developed enough to control their bodies. In all other primate species, brain growth slows dramatically soon after birth",563
Page 137,"122 T h e H a p p i n e Hy p o t h e s i s because the brain is mostly complete and ready for service; only some fine tuning during a few years of childhood play and learning is needed. In hu­ mans, however, the rapid rate of embryonic brain growth continues for about two years after birth, followed by a slower but continuous increase in brain weight for another twenty years .32 Humans are the only creatures on Earth whose young are utterly helpless for years, and heavily dependent on adult care for more than a decade. Given the enormous burden that is the human child, women cant do it on their own. Studies of hunter-gatherer societies show that mothers of young children cannot collect enough calories to keep themselves and their children aliv.33They rely on the large quantity of food as well as the protection provided by males in their peak years of productivity. Big brains, so useful for gossip and social manipulation (as well as hunting and gather­ ing), could therefore have evolved only if men began chipping in. But in the competitive game of evolution, its a losing move for a male to provide resources to a child who is not his own. So active fathers, male-female pair-bonds, male sexual jealousy, and big-headed babies all co-evolved— that is, arose gradually but together. A man who felt some desire to stay with a woman, guard her fidelity, and contribute to the rearing of their chil­ dren could produce smarter children than could his less paternal competi­ tors. In environments in which intelligence was highly adaptive (which may have been all human environments, once we began making tools), male investment in children may have paid off for the men themselves (for their genes, that is), and therefore became more common with each suc­ cessive generation. But from what rawmaterial could a tie evolve between men and women where one did not exist before? Evolution cannot design anything from scratch. Evolution is a process in which bones and hormones and behav­ ioral patterns that were already coded for by the genes are changed slightly (by random mutation of those genes) and then selected if they confer an advantage on an individual. It didn't take much change to modify the at­ tachment system, which every man and every woman had used as a child to attach to mom, and have it link up with the mating system, which was already turning on in each young person at the time of puberty.",505
Page 138,"Love andAttachments 123 Granted, this theory is speculative (the fossilized bones of a committed father look no different from those of an indifferent one), but it does tie to­ gether neatly many of the distinctive features of human life, such as our painful childbirth, long infancy, large brains, and high intelligence. The theory connects these biological quirks about human beings to some of the most important emotional oddities of our species: the existence of strong and (often) enduring emotional bonds between men and women, and be­ tween men and children. Because men and women in a relationship have many conflicting interests, evolutionary theory does not view love relation­ ships as harmonious partnerships for childrearing ;34but a universal feature of human cultures is that men and women form relationships intended to last for years (marriage) that constrain their sexual behavior in some way and institutionalize their ties to children and to each other. Two L o v e s , T w o E r r o r s Take one ancient attachment system, mix with an equal measure of care- giving system, throw in a modified mating system and voila, that’sromantic love. I seem to have lost something here; romantic love is so much more than the sum of its parts. It is an extraordinary psychological state that launched the Trojan war, inspired much of the world’s best (sind worst) music and literature, and gave many of us the most perfect days of our lives. But I think that romantic love is widely misunderstood, and looking at its psychological subcomponents can clear up some puzzles and guide the way around love’spitfalls. In some comers of universities, the professors tell their students that ro­ mantic love is a social construction, invented by the French troubadours of the twelfth century with their stories of chivalry, idealization of women, and the uplifting ache of unconsummated desire. It’s certainly true that cul- Iures create their own understandings of psychological phenomena, but many of those phenomena will occur regardless of what people think about them. (For example, death is socially constructed by every culture, but bod­ ies die without consulting those constructions.) A survey of ethnographies",451
Page 139,"124 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s from 166 human cultures 35found clear evidence of romantic love in 8 8 percent of them; for the rest, the ethnographic record was too thin to be sure either way. What the troubadours did give us is a particular mytH of “true”love—the idea that real love bums brightly and passionately, and then it just keeps on burning until death, and then it just keeps on burning after death as the lovers are reunited in heaven. This myth seems to have grown and diffused in modem times into a set of interrelated ideas about loye and marriage. As I see it, the modem myth of true love involves these beliefs: True love is passionate love that never fades; if you are in true love, you should marry that person; if love ends, you should leave that person because it was not true love; and if you can find the right person, you will have true love for­ ever. You might not believe this myth yourself, particularly if you are older than thirty; but many young people in Western nations are raised on it, and it acts as an ideal that they unconsciously carrywith them even if they scoff at it. (Its not just Hollywood that perpetrates the myth; Bollywood, the In­ dian film industry, is even more romanticized.) But if true love is defined as eternal passion, it is biologically impossible. To see this, and to save the dignity of love, you have to understand the dif­ ference between two kinds of love: passionate and companionate. Accord­ ing to the love researchers Ellen Berscheid and Elaine Walster, passionate love is a'wildly emotional state in which tender and sexual feelings, elation and pain, anxiety and relief, altruism and jealousy coexist in a confusion of feelings.”36 Passionate love is the love you fall into. It is what happens when Cupids golden arrow hits your heart, and, in an instant, the world around you is transformed. You crave union with your beloved. You want, somehow, to crawl into each other. This is the urge that Plato captured in The Symposium, in which Aristophanes’toast to love is a myth about its ori­ gins. Aristophanes says that people originally had four legs, four arms, and two faces, but one day the gods felt threatened by the power and arrogance of human beings and decided to cut them in half. Ever since that day, people have wandered the world searching for their other halves. (Some people originally had two male faces, some two female, and the rest a male and a female, thereby explaining the diversity of sexual orientation.) As proof, Aristophanes asks us to imagine that Hephaestus (the god of fire",584
Page 140,"Love andAttachments 125 and hence of blacksmiths) were to come upon two lovers as they lay to­ gether in an embrace, and say to them: What is it you human beings really want from each other? ... Is this your hearts desire, then—for the two ofyou to become parts of the same whole, as near as can be, and never to separate, day or night? Because if thats your desire, Fd like to weld you together and join you into some­ thing that is naturally whole, so that the two of you are made into one. Then the two of you would share*one life, as long as you lived, because you would be one being, and by the same token, when you died, you would be one and not two in Hades, having died a single death. Look at your love, and see if this is what you des.37 Aristophanes says that no lovers would turn down such an offer. Berscheid and Walster define companionate love, in contrast, as “the affection we feel for those with whom our lives are deeply intertwined .”38 Companionate love grows slowly over the years as lovers apply their attach­ ment and caregiving systems to each other, and as they begin to rely upon, care for, and trust each other. If the metaphor for passionate love is fire, the metaphor for companionate love is vines growing, intertwining, and gradually binding two people together. The contrast of wild and calm forms of love has occurred to people in many cultures. As a woman in a hunter- gatherer tribe in Namibia put it: “When two people come together their hearts are on fire and their passion is verygreat. After a while, the fire cools and that’s how it stays.”39 Passionate love is a drug. Its symptoms overlap with those of heroin (eu­ phoric well-being, sometimes described in sexual terms) and cocaine (eupho­ ria combined with giddiness and energy ).40It’s no wonder: Passionate love alters the activity of several parts of the brain, including parts that are in­ volved in the release of dopamine 41Any experience that feels intensely good releases dopamine, and the dopamine link is crucial here because drugs that artificially raise dopamine levels, as do heroin and cocaine, put you at risk of addiction. If you take cocaine once amonth, you won’t become addicted, but if you take it every day, you will. No drug can keep you continuously high. ’Ihe brain reacts to a chronic surplus of dopamine, develops neurochemical",532
Page 141,"126 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s reactions that oppose it, and restores its own equilibrium. At that point, toler­ ance has set in, and when the drug is withdrawn, the brain is unbalanced in the opposite direction: pain, lethargy, and despair follow withdrawal from co­ caine or from passionate love. So if passionate love is a drug—literally a drug—it has to wear off even­ tually. Nobody can stayhigh forever (although if you find passionate love in a long-distance relationship, its like taking cocaine once a month; the drug can retain its potency because of your suffering between doses). If passion­ ate love is allowed to run its joyous course, there must come a day when it weakens. One of the lovers usually feels the change first. Its like waking up from a shared dream to see your sleeping partner drooling. In those mo­ ments of returning sanity, the lover may see flaws and defects to which she was blind before. The beloved falls off the pedestal, and then, because our minds are so sensitive to changes, her change in feeling can take on exag­ gerated importance. “Oh, my God,” she thinks, “the magic has worn off— Im not in love with him anymore.” If she subscribes to the myth of true love, she might even consider breaking up with him. After all, if the magic ended, it cant be true love. But if she does end the relationship, she might be making a mistake. Passionate love does not turn into companionate love. Passionate love and companionate love are two separate processes, and they have different time courses. Their diverging paths produce two danger points, two places where many people make grave mistakes. In figure . , I6 1drawn out how the intensity of passionate and companionate love might vary in one per­ sons relationship over the course of six months. Passionate love ignites, it bums, and it can reach its maximum temperature within days. During its weeks or months of madness, lovers cant help but think about marriage, and often they talk about it, too. Sometimes they even accept Hephaestus’s offer and commit to marriage. This is often a mistake. Nobody can think straight when high on passionate love. The rider is as besotted as the ele­ phant. People are not allowed to sign contracts when they are drunk, and I sometimes wish we could prevent people from proposing marriage when they are high on passionate love because once a marriage proposal is ac­ cepted, families are notified, and a date is set, its very hard to stop the train. The drug is likely to wear off at some point during the stressful wed-",572

The other danger point is the day the drug weakens its grip. Passionate love doesn’t end on that day, but the crazy and obsessional high period does. The rider regains his senses and can, for the first time, assess where Ihe elephant has taken them. Breakups often happen at this point, and for many couples that’s a good thing. Cupid is usually portrayed as an impish I*1low because he’s so fond ofjoining together the most inappropriate cou­ ples. But sometimes breaking up is premature, because if the lovers had stuck it out, if they had given companionate love a chance to grow, they might have found true love. True love exists, I believe, but it is not—cannot be—passion that lasts forever. True love, the love that undergirds strong marriages, is simply slrong companionate love, with some added passion, between two people who are firmly committed to each other .42Companionate love looks weak in the graph above because it can never attain the intensity of passionate love. But if we change the time scale from six months to sixty years, as in Ilit* next figure, it is passionate love that seems trivial—a flash in the pan— while companionate love canlast a lifetime. When we admire a couple still in love on their fiftieth anniversary, it is this blend of loves—mostly com­ panionate—that we are admiring.",352

If you are in passionate love and want to celebrate your passion, read po­ etry. If your ardor has calmed and you want to understand your evolving re­ lationship, read psychology. But if you have just ended a relationship and would like to believe you are better off without love, read philosophy. Oh, there is plenty of work extolling the virtues of love, but when you look closely, you find a deep ambivalence. Love of God, love of neighbor, love of truth, love of beauty—all of these are urged upon us. But the passionate, erotic love of a real person? Heavens no! In the ancient East, the problem with love is obvious: Love is attachment. Attachments, particularly sensual and sexual attachments, must be broken to permit spiritual progress. Buddha said, “So long as lustful desire, however small, ofman forwomen isnot controlled, solongthe mind ofman isnot free, but is bound like a calf tied to a c.”43The Laws ofManu, an ancient Hindu treatise on how young Brahmin men should live, was even more negative about women: “It is theverynature ofwomen to corrupt men here on earth .”44 Even Confucius, who was not focused on breaking attachments, saw roman­ tic loveand sexualityasthreats to the highervirtues offilial pietyand loyaltyto ones superiors: “I have never seen anyone who lovedvirtue as much as sex .”45 (Of course, Buddhism and Hinduism are diverse, andboth have changedwith time and place. Some modem leaders, such as the Dalai Lama, accept roman­",416
Page 144,"Love andAttachments 129 tic love and its attendant sexualityas an important part oflife. But the spirit of the ancient religious and philosophical texts is much more negative.)46 In the West, the story is a bit different: Love is widely celebrated by the poets from Homer onwards. Love launches the drama of the Iliad, and the Odyssey ends with the lusty return of Odysseus to Penelope. When the Greek and Roman philosophers get hold of romantic love, however, they usually either despise it or try to turn it into something else. Platos Sympo­ sium, for example, is an entire dialogue devoted to the praise of love. But you never know what position Plato holds until Socrates speaks, and when Socrates speaks, he trashes the eulogies to love thatAristophanes and others havejust given. He describes how love produces a “disease”among the ani­ mals: “First they are sick for intercourse with each other, then for nurturing their young .”47(Note: Mating system leads to caregiving system.) For Plato, when human love resembles animal love, it is degrading. The love of a man for a woman, as it aims at procreation, is therefore a debased kind of love. Platos Socrates then shows how love can transcend its animal origins by aiming at something higher. Wlien an older man loves a young man, their love can be elevating for both because the older man can, in between rounds of intercourse, teach the young man about virtue and philosophy But even this love must be a stepping stone only: When a man loves a beau­ tiful body he must learn to love beauty in general, not the beauty of one par­ ticular body He must come to find beauty in mens souls, and then in ideas and philosophy Ultimately he comes to know the form of beauty itself: Theresultisthat hewill seethebeautyofknowledgeandbe lookingmainly not at beauty in a single example—as a servant would who favored the beautyofalittle boyoraman ora singlecustom ... but the lover is turned to the great seaofbeauty, and, gazingupon this, he gives birth tomany glo­ riouslybeautiful ideas and theories, in unstinting loveofwisdom. .48 The essential nature of love as an attachment between two people is re­ jected; love can be dignified onlywhen it is converted into an appreciation of beauty in general. The later Stoics also object to the particularity of love, to the way it places the source of ones happiness in the hands of another person, whom",546
Page 145,"130 Th e H a p p i n e sHsy p o t h e s i s one cannot fullycontrol. Even the Epicureans, whose philosophywas based on the pursuit of pleasure, value friendship but oppose romantic love. In De Rerum Natura, the philosophical poet Lucretius lays out the fullest surviv­ ing statement of the philosophy of Epicurus. The end of Book 4 is widely known as the “TiradeAgainst Love,”in which Lucretius compares love to a wound, a cancer, and a sickness. The Epicureans were experts on desire and its satisfaction; they objected to passionate love because it cannot be satisfied: When two lie tasting, limb by limb life’sbloom, whenflesh givesforetaste ofdelight, and Venus is ready to saw thefemalefield, they hungrily seize each other, mouth to mouth the spittleflows, they pant, press tooth to lip— vainly,for they can chafe no substance off nor pierce and begone, one body in the other For often this seems to be their wish, theirgoal, sogreedily do they cling in passions bond.49 Christianity brought forward many of these classical fears of love. Jesus commands his followers to love God, using the same""words as Moses (“With all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might,” M a t t h , w 2 23 7, in referring to D e u t e r o n o6:5). Jesus second commandment is to love one another: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself” ( Ma t t h e w 2 23 9). But what can it mean to love-others as one loves oneself? The psy­ chological origins of love are in attachment to parents and sexual partners. We do not attach to ourselves; we do not seek security and fulfillment in our­ selves. What Jesus seems to mean is that we should value others as much as we value ourselves; we should be kind and generous even to strangers and even to our enemies. This uplifting message is relevant to the issues of reci­ procity and hypocrisythat I talked about in chapters 3 and 4, but it has little to do with the psychological systems I have been covering in this chapter. Rather, Christian love has focused on two keywords:-caritas and agape. Can- tas (the origin of our word “charity”) is a kind of intense benevolence and good will; agape is a Greekword that refers to a kind of selfless, spiritual love",538
Page 146,"Love andAttachments 131 with no sexuality, no clinging to a particular other person. (Of course, Chris­ tianity endorses the love of a man and a woman within marriage, but even this love is idealized as the love of Christ for his churc— E p h e s i a5:25) As in Plato, Christian love is love stripped of its essential particularity, its fo­ cus on a specific other person. Love is remodeled into a general attitude to­ ward a much larger, even infinite, class of objects. Caritas ancj agape are beautiful, but they are not related to or derived from the kinds of love that people need. Although I would like to live in a world in which everyone radiates benevolence toward everyone else, I would rather live in a world in which there was at least one person who loved me specifically, and whom I loved in return. Suppose Harlow had raised rhesus monkeys under two conditions. For the first group, each was reared in its own cage, but each day Harlow put in a new but verynurturing*adult female monkey as a companion. For the second group, each was reared in a cage with its own mother, and then each day Harlow put in a new and not par- ticularly nice other monkey. The monkeys in the first group got something like caritas—benevolence without particularity—and they would probably emerge emotionally damaged. Without having fortnted an attachment rela- Iionship, they would likely be fearful of new experiences and unable to love orcare for other monkeys. The monkeys in the second group would have had something closer to a normal rhesus monkey childhood, and would probably vmerge healthy and able to love. Monkeys and people need close and long- lasting attachments to particular others. In chapter 9, I will propose that ngape is real, but usually short-lived. It can change lives and enrich lives, but il cannot substitute for the kinds of love based on attachments. There are several reasons why real human love might make philosophers uncomfortable. First, passionate love is notorious for making people illogi­ cal and irrational, and Western philosophers have long thought that morality is grounded in rationality. (In chapter8, I will argue against this view.) Love is a kind of insanity, and many people have, while crazed with passion, ru­ ined their lives and those of others. Much of the philosophical opposition to love may therefore be well-intentioned advice by the sages to the young: Shut your ears to the sirens’deceitful song. I think, however, that at least two less benevolent motivations are at work. First, there may be a kind of hypocritical self-interest in which the",578
Page 147,"132 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s older generation says, “Do as we say, not as we did.” Buddha and St. Augus­ tine, for example, drank their fill of passionate love as young men and came out only much later as opponents of sexual attachments. Moral codes are designed to keep orderwithin society; they urge us to rein in our desires and play our assigned roles. Romantic love is notorious for making young people giveless than a damn about the rules and conventions of their society, about caste lines, or about feuds between Capulets and Montagues. So the sages’ constant attempts to redefine love as something spiritual and prosocial sound to me like the moralism of parents who, having enjoyed a variety of love affairs when they were young, now try to explain to their daughter why she should save herself for marriage. A,second motivation is the fear of death. Jamie Goldenberg 50 at the Uni­ versityof Colorado has shown that when people are asked to reflect on their own mortality, they find the physical aspects of sexuality more disgusting, and they are less likely to agree with an essay arguing for the essential simi­ larity of people and animals. Goldenberg and her colleagues believe that people in all cultures have a pervasive fear of death. Human beings all know that they are going do die, and sohuman cultures go to great lengths to con­ struct systems of meaning that dignify life and convince people that their lives have more meaning than those of the animals that die all around them. The extensive regulation of sex in many cultures, the attempt to link love to God and then to cut away the sex, is part of an elaborate defense against the gnawing fear of mortality .51 If this is true, if the sages have a variety of unstated reasons for warning us away from passionate love and attachments of many kinds, perhaps we should be selective in heeding their advice. Perhaps we need to look at our own lives, lived in a world very different from theirs, and also at the evi­ dence about whether attachments are good or bad for us.

Page 148,"Love andAttachments 133 Europe to study the factors that affect the suicide rate. His findings can be summarized in one word: constraints. No matter how he parsed the data, people who had fewer social constraints, bonds, and obligations were more likely to kill themselves. Durkheim looked at the “degree of integration of religious society” and found that Protestants, who lived the least demand­ ing religious lives at the time, had higher suicide rates than did Catholics; Jews, with the densest network of social and religious obligations, had the lowest. He examined the “degree of integration of domestic society”—the family—and found the same thing: People living alone were most likely to kill themselves; married people, less; married people with children, still less. Durkheim concluded that people need obligations ancj constraints to provide structure and meaning to their lives: “The more weakened the groups to which [a man] belongs, the less he depends on them, the more he consequently depends only on himself and recognizes no other rules of conduct than what are founded on his private interests .”52 A hundred years of further studies have confirmed Durkheim’s diagno­ sis. If you want to predict how happy someone is, or how long she will live (and if you are not allowed to ask about her genes or personality), you should find out about her social relationships. Having strong social rela­ tionships strengthens the immune system, extends life (more than does quitting smoking), speeds recovery from surgery, and reduces the risks of depression and anxiety disorders .53Its not just that extroverts are naturally happier and healthier; when introverts are forced to be more outgoing, they usually enjoy it and find that it boosts their moo.54Even people who think they dont want a lot of social contact still benefit from it. And its not just that “we all need somebody to lean on”; recent work on giving support shows that caring for others is often more beneficial than is receiving help .55We need to interact and intertwine with others; we need the give and the take; we need to belong .56An ideology of extreme personal free­ dom can be dangerous because it encourages people to leave homes, jobs, cities, and marriages in search of personal and professional fulfillment, thereby breaking the relationships that were probably their best hope for such fulfillment.

What parent could resist the urge to cross off the traumas, to correct the self-inflicted wounds'? But be careful with that pencil. Your good intentions could make things worse. If Nietzsche is right that what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, then the complete erasure of serious adversity from your child’s future would leave him or her weak and underdeveloped. This chapter is about what we might call the “adversity hypothesis,”which says that people need adversity, setbacks, and perhaps even trauma to reach the highest levels of strength, fulfillment, and personal development. Nietzsche’sdictum can’t be literally true, at least, not all the time. People who face the real and present threat of their own deaths, orwho witness the violent deaths of others, sometimes develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a debilitating condition that leaves its victims anxious and over­ reactive. People who suffer from PTSD are changed, sometimes perma­ nently: They panic or crumble more easily when faced with later adversity. Even if we take Nietzsche figuratively (which he would have much pre­ ferred anyway), fiftyyears of research on stress shows that stressors are gen­ erally bad for people ,3 contributing to depression, anxiety disorders, and heart disease. So let’sbe cautious about accepting the adversity hypothesis. Let’s look to scientific research to figure out when adversity is beneficial, and when it is harmful. The answer is not just “adversitywithin limits.”It’sa much more interesting story, one that reveals how human beings grow and thrive, and how you (and your child) can best profit from the adversity that surely lies in your future. P o s t t r a u m a t i G r o w t h Greg’s life fell apart on April8 , 1999. On that day, his wife and two chil­ dren, ages four and seven, disappeared. It took Greg three days just to find out that they had not died in a car crash; Amy had taken the children and run off with a man she had met in a shopping mall a few weeks earlier. The four of them were now driving around the country and had been spotted in several Western states. The private detective Greg hired quickly discovered",514
Page 152,"The Uses ofAdversity 137 that the man who had ruined Gregs life earned his living as a con artist and petty criminal. How could this have happened? Greg felt like Job, stripped in one day of all he loved most. And like Job, he had no explana­ tion for what had befallen him. Greg ,4an old friend of mine, called me to see whether I, as a psycholo­ gist, could offer insight into how his wife had fallen under the influence of such a fraud. The one insight I could offer was that the man sounded like a psychopath. Most psychopaths are not violent (although most serial mur­ derers and serial rapists are psychopaths). They are people, mostly men, who have no moral emotions, no attachment systems, and no concerns for others.5 Because they feel no shame, embarrassment, or guilt, they find it easy to manipulate people into giving them money, sex, and trust. I told Greg that if this man was indeed a psychopath, he was incapable of love and would soon tire ofAmy and the kids. Greg would probably see his chil­ dren again soon. Two months later, Amy returned. The police restored the children to Greg’s custody. Gregs panic phase was over, but so was his marriage, and Greg began the long and painful process of rebuilding his life. He was now a single parent living on an assistant professor’s salary, and he faced years of legal expenses fighting Amy over the custody of their children. He had little hope of finishing the book his academic career depended upon, and he worried about his children’s mental health, and his own. What was he going to do? I visited Greg a few months later. It was a beautiful August evening, and as we sat on his porch, Greg told me about how the crisis had affected him. He was still in pain, but he had learned that many people cared about him and were there to help him. Families from his church were bringing him meals and helping out with childcare. His parents were selling their house in Utah and moving to Charlottesville to help him raise the children. Also, Greg said that the experience had radically changed his perspective about what mattered in life. As long as he had his children back, career success was no longer so important to him. Greg said he now treated people differently, a change related to his change in values: He found him­ self reacting to others with much greater sympathy, love, and forgiveness. 11ejust couldn’t get mad at people for little things anymore. And then Greg",533
Page 153,"138 T h e H a p p i n e Hy p o t h e s i s said something so powerful that I choked up. Referring to the often sad and moving solo that is at the heart of many operas, he said: “This is my monient to sing the aria. I don’t want to, I don’t want to have this chance, but it’shere now, and what am I going to do about it? Am I going to rise to the occasion?” To have framed things in such a way showed that he was already rising. With the help of family friends, and deep religious faith, Greg rebuilt his life, finished his book, and two years later found a betterjob. When I spoke to him recently he told me he still feels wounded by what happened. But he also said that many of the positive changes had endured, and that he now experiences more joy from each day with his children than he did be­ fore the crisis. For decades, research in health psychology focused on stress and its damaging effects. A major concern in this research literature has always been resilience—the ways people cope with adversity, fend off damage, and “bounce back” to normal functioning. But it’s only in the last fifteen years that researchers have gone beyond resilience and begun to focus on the benefits of severe stress. These benefits are sometimes referred to col­ lectively as “posttraumatic growth ,”6 in direct contrast to posttraumatic stress disorder. Researchers have now studied people facing many kinds of adversity, including cancer, heart disease, HIV, rape, assault, paralysis, in­ fertility, house fires, plane crashes, and earthquakes. Researchers have studied how people cope with the loss of their strongest attachments: chik dren, spouses or partners, and parents. This large body of research shows that although traumas, crises, and tragedies come in a thousand forms, people benefit from them in three primary ways—the same ones that Greg talked about. The first benefit is that rising to a challenge reveals your hidden abili­ ties, and seeing these abilities changes your self-concept. None of us knows what we are really capable of enduring. You might say to yourself, “I would die if I lost X,”or “I could never survive whatY is going through,”yet these are statements spun out of thin air by the rider. If you did lose X, or find yourself in the same position as Y, your heart would not stop beating. You would respond to the world as you found it, and most of those re­ sponses would be automatic. People sometimes say they are numb or on",538
Page 154,"The Uses ofAdversity 139 autopilot after a terrible loss or trauma. Consciousness is severely altered, yet somehow the body keeps moving. Over the next few weeks some de­ gree of normalcy returns as one struggles to make sense of the loss and of ones altered circumstances. What doesn’t kill you makes you, by defini­ tion, a survivor, about whom people then say, “I could never survive what Y is going through.”One of the most common lessons people draw from be­ reavement or trauma is that they are much stronger than they realized, and this new appreciation of their strength then gives them confidence to face future challenges. And they are not just confabulating a silver lining to wrap around a dark cloud; people who have suffered through battle, rape, concentration camps, or traumatic personal losses often seem to be inocu­ lated7 against future stress: They recover more quickly, in part because they know they can cope. Religious leaders have often pointed to exactly this benefit of suffering. As Paul said in his Letter to the Romans ( 5:3-4 ): ""Suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope.” More recently, the Dalai Lama said: “The per­ son who has had more experience of hardships can stand more firmly in the face of problems than the person who has never experienced suffering. I'rom this angle, then, some suffering can be a good lesson for life.”8 The second class of benefit concerns relationships. Adversity is a filter. When a person is diagnosed with cancer, or a couple loses a child, some friends and family members rise to the occasion and look for any way they can to express support or to be helpful. Others turn away, perhaps unsure of what to say or unable to overcome their own discomfort with the situation. Hut adversity doesn’t just separate the fair-weather friends from the true; it strengthens relationships and it opens peoples hearts to one another. We of­ ten develop love for those we care for, and we usually feel love and gratitude toward those who cared for us in a time of need. In a large study of bereave­ ment, Susan Nolen-Hoeksema and her colleagues at Stanford University found that one of the most common effects of losing a loved one was that the bereaved had a greater appreciation of and tolerance for the other people in his or her life. A woman in the study, whose partner had died of cancer, explained: “[The loss] enhanced my relationship with other people because I realize that time is so important, and you can waste so much effort on small, insignificant events or feeling.”9Like Greg, this bereaved",553
Page 155,"140 T h e H a p p i n eH y p o t h e s i s woman found herself relating to others in a more loving and less petty way. Trauma seems to shut off the motivation to play Machiavellian tit for tat with its emphasis on self-promotion and competition. This change in ways of relating points to the third common benefit: Trauma changes priorities and philosophies toward the present (“Live each day to the fullest”) and toward other people. We have all heard stories about rich and powerful people who had a moral conversion when faced with death. In 1993, I saw one of the grandest such stories written in the rocks outside the Indian city of Bhubaneswar, where I spent three months study­ ing culture and morality. KingAshoka, after assuming control of the Maurya empire (in central India) around 272 BCE, set out to expand his territory by conquest. He was successful, subduing by slaughter many of the peoples and kingdoms around him. But after a particularly bloody victory over the Kalinga people, near what is now Bhubaneswar, he was seized with horror and remorse. He converted to Buddhism, renounced all further conquest by violence, and devoted his life to creating a kingdom based on justice and respect for dharma (the cosmic law of Hinduism and Buddhism). He wrote out his vision of a just society and his rules for virtuous behavior, and had these edicts carved into rock walls throughout his kingdom. He sent emis­ saries as far away as Greece to spread his vision of peace, virtue, and reli­ gious tolerance. Ashoka’sconversion was caused byvictory, not adversity, yet people are often traumatized—as modern research on soldiers 10indicates— by killing as well as by facing the threat of death. Like so many who expe­ rience posttraumatic growth, Ashoka underwent a profound transformation. In his edicts, he described himself as having become more forgiving, com­ passionate, and tolerant of those who differed with him. Few people have the chance to go from mass murderer to patron of hu­ manity, but a great many people facing death report changes in values and perspectives. A diagnosis of cancer is often described, in retrospect, as a wake-up call, a reality check, or a turning point. Many people consider changing careers or reducing the time they spend at work. The reality that people often wake up to is that life is a gift they have been taking for granted, and that people matter more than money. Charles Dickenss A Christmas Carol captures a deep truth about the effects of facing mortality: A fewminutes with the ghost of “Christmas Yet to Come”converts Scrooge,",567

I don’t want to celebrate suffering, prescribe it for everyone, or minimize the moral imperative to reduce it where we can. I don’t want to ignore the pain that ripples out from each diagnosis of cancer, spreading fear along lines of kinship and friendship. I want only to make the point that suffering is not always all bad for all people. There is usually some good mixed in with the bad, and those who find it have found something precious: a key to moral and spiritual development. As Shakespeare wrote: Sweet are the uses ofadversity Which like the toad., ugly and venomous, Wearsyet a preciousjewel in his head . 11 M u s t W e S u f f e r? The adversity hypothesis has a weak and a strong version. In the weak ver­ sion, adversity can lead to growth, strength, joy, and self-improvement, by the three mechanisms of posttraumatic growth described above. The weak version is well-supported by research, but it has few clear implications for how we should live our lives. The strong version of the hypothesis is more unsettling: It states that people must endure adversity to grow, and that the highest levels of growth and development are only open to those who have laced and overcome great adversity If the strongversion of the hypothesis is valid, it has profound implications for how we should live our lives and structure our societies. It means that we should take more chances and suf­ fer more defeats. It means that we might be dangerously overprotecting our children, offering them lives of bland safety and too much counseling while depriving them of the “critical incidents ”12that would help them to grow strong and to develop the most intense friendships. It means that heroic societies, which fear dishonor more than death, or societies that struggle to­ gether through war, might produce better human beings than can a world of peace and prosperity in which people’s expectations rise so high that they sue each other for “emotional damages.”",448
Page 157,"142 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s But is the strongversion valid? People often say that they have been pro­ foundly changed by adversity, yet researchers have so far collected little ev­ idence of adversity-induced personality change beyond such reports. Peoples scores on personality tests are fairly stable over the course of a few years, even for people who report that they have changed a great deal in the interim .13In one of the few studies that tried to verify reports of growth by asking the subjects’ friends about them, the friends noticed much less change than the subjects had reported .14 These studies might, however, have been looking for change in the wrong place. Psychologists often approach personality by measuring basic traits such as the “big five”: neuroticism, extroversion, openness to new experi­ ences, agreeableness (warmth/niceness), and conscientiousness .15These traits are facts about the elephant, about a persons automatic reactions to various situations. They are fairly similar between identical twins reared apart, indicating that they are influenced in part by genes, although they are also influenced by changes in the conditions o£ones life or the roles one plays, such as becoming a parent .16But psychologist Dan McAdams has suggested that personality really has three levels,17and too much attention has been paid to the lowest level, the basic traits. A second level of personal­ ity, “characteristic adaptations,” includes personal goals, defense and coping mechanisms, values, beliefs, and life-stageconcerns (such as those ofparent­ hood or retirement) that people develop to succeed in their particular roles and niches. These adaptations are influenced by basic traits: A person high on neuroticism will have many more'defense mechanisms; an extrovert will relymore heavilyon social relationships. But in this middle level, the persons basic traits are made to mesh with facts about the persons environment and stage of life. When those facts change—as after losing a spouse—the per­ sons characteristic adaptations change. The elephant might be slow to change, but the elephant and rider, working together, find new ways of get­ ting through the day The third level of personality is that of the “life story” Human beings in every culture are fascinated by stories; we create them wherever we can. (See those seven stars up there? They are seven sisters who once . . . ) Its no different with our own lives. We can’t stop ourselves from creating what",522
Page 158,"The Uses ofAdversity 143 McAdams describes as an “evolving story that integrates a reconstructed past, perceived present, and anticipated future into a coherent and vitalizing life myth,”18Although the lowest level of personality is mostly about the ele­ phant, the life story is written primarily by the rider. You create your storyin consciousness as you interpret your own behavior, and as you listen to other peoples thoughts about you. The life story is not the work of a historian-— remember that the rider has no access to the real causes of your behavior; it is more like a work of historical fiction that makes plenty of references to real events and connects them by dramatizations and interpretations that might or might not be true to the spirit of what happened. From this three-level perspective, it becomes clear why adversity might be necessary for optimal human development. Most of the life goals that people pursue at the level of “characteristic adaptations”can be sorted— as Ihe psychologist Robert Emmons 19has found—into four categories: work and achievement, relationships and intimacy, religion and spirituality, and generativity (leaving a legacy and contributing something to society). Al­ though it is generally good for you to pursue goals, not all goals are equal. People who strive primarily for achievement and wealth are, Emmons finds, less happy, on average, than those whose strivings focus on the other three categories .20The reason takes us back to happiness traps and con­ spicuous consumption (see chapter 5): Because human beings were shaped by evolutionary processes to pursue success, not happiness, people enthu­ siastically pursue goals that will help them win prestige in zero-sum com­ petitions. Success in these competitions feels good but gives no lasting pleasure, and it raises the bar for future success. When tragedy strikes, however, it knocks you off the treadmill and forces a decisioh: Hop back on and return to business as usual, or trysomething else? 'Ihere is a window of time—just a few weeks or months after the tragedy— tluringwhich you are more open to something else. During this time, achieve­ ment goals often lose their allure, sometimes coming to seem pointless. If you shift toward other goals—family, religion, or helping others—you shift to in­ conspicuous consumption, and the pleasures derived along the way are not fully subject to adaptation (treadmill) effects. The pursuit of these goals therefore leads to more happiness but less Wealth (on average). Many people",518
Page 159,"144 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s change their goals in the wake of adversity; they resolve to work less, to love and play more. If in those first few months you take action—you do some­ thing that changes your daily life—then the changes might stick. But if you donothing more than make a resolution (“I must never forget my new outlook on life”), thenyouwill soon slipbackinto old habits and pursue old goals. The rider can exert some influence at forks in the road; but the elephant handles dailylife, responding automatically to the environment.Adversity maybe nec­ essaryfor growth because it forces you to stop speeding along the road of life, allowingyou tonotice the paths that were branching offall along, and tothink about where you reallywant to end up. At the third level of personality, the need for adversity is even more obvi­ ous: You need interesting material to write a good story. McAdams says that stories are'“fundamentally about the vicissitudes of human intention orga­ nized in time .”2You cant have a good life storywithout vicissitudes, and if the best you can come up with is that your parents refused to buy you a sports car for your sixteenth birthday, nobody will want to read your mem­ oirs, In the thousands of life stories McAdams has gathered, several genres are associated with well-being. For example, in the “commitment story,” the protagonist has a supportive family background, is sensitized early in life to the sufferings of others, is guided by a clear and compelling personal ideology, and, at some point, transforms or redeems failures, mistakes, or crises into a positive outcome, a process that often involves setting new goals that commit the self to helping others. The life of the Buddha is a classic example. In contrast, some peoples life stories show a “contamination” sequence in which emotionally positive events go bad and everything is spoiled. People who tell such stories are, not surprisingly, more likely to be de­ pressed .22Indeed, part of the pathology of depression is that, while rumi­ nating, the depressed person reworks her life narrative by using the tools of Becks negative triad: Fm bad, the world is bad, and my future is dark. Al­ though adversity that is not overcome can create a story of depressing bleakness, substantial adversity might be necessary for a meaningful story. McAdams’s ideas are profoundly important for understanding posttrau­ matic growth. His three levels of personality allow us to think about coher­",555
Page 160,"The Uses ofAdversity 145 ence among the levels. What happens when the three levels of personality don’t match up? Imagine a woman whose basic traits are warm and gregar­ ious but who strives for success in a career that offers few chances for close contacts with people, and whose life story is about an artist forced by her parents to pursue a practical career. She is a mess of mismatched mo­ tives and stories, and it may be that only through adversity will she be able to make the radical changes she would need to achieve coherence among levels. The psychologists Ken Sheldon and Tim Kasser have found that people who are mentally healthy and happy have a higher degree of “verti­ cal coherence” among their goals—that is, higher-level (long term) goals and lower-level (immediate) goals all fit together well so that pursuing ones short-term goals advances the pursuit of long-term goals .23 Trauma often shatters belief systems and robs people of their sense of meaning. In so doing, it forces people to put the pieces back together, and often they do so by using God or some other higher purpose as a unifying principle.24London and Chicago seized the opportunities provided by their great fires to remake themselves into grander and more coherent cities. People sometimes seize such opportunities, too, rebuilding beautifully those parts of their lives and life stories that they could never have torn down vol­ untarily. When people report having grown after coping with adversity, they could be trying to describe a new sense of inner coherence. This coherence might not be visible to ones friends, but it feels like growth, strength, matu­ rity, and wisdom from the inside .25 B l e s s e dA r e t h e S e n s e M a k e r s When bad things happen to good people, we have a problem. We know con­ sciously that life is unfair, but unconsciously we see the world through the lens of reciprocity The downfall of an evil man (in our biased and moralistic assessment) is no puzzle: He had it coming to him. But when the victim was virtuous, we struggle to make sense of his tragedy At an intuitive level, we all believe in karma, the Hindu notion that people reap what they sow. 'Ihe psychologist Mel Lerner has demonstrated that we are so motivated to",488
Page 161,"146 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s believe that people get what they deserve and deserve what they get that we often blame the victim of a tragedy, particularly when we cant achieve jus­ tice by punishing a perpetrator or compensating the victim .26 In Lerner’sexperiments, the desperate need to make sense of events can lead people to inaccurate conclusions (for example, a woman “led on” a rapist); but, in general, the ability to make sense of tragedy and then find benefit in it is the key that unlocks posttraumatic growth .27When trauma strikes, some people find the key dangling around their necks with instruc­ tions printed on it. Others are left to fend for themselves, and they do not fend as well. Psychologists have devoted a great deal of effort to figuring out who benefits from trauma and who is crushed. The answer compounds the already great unfairness of life: Optimists are more likely to benefit than pessimists .28 Optimists are, for the most part, people who won the cortical lottery: They have a high happiness setpoint, they habitually look on the bright side, and they easily find silver linings. Life has a way of mak­ ing the rich get richer and the happy get happier. When a crisis strikes, people cope in three primary ways :29 active coping (taking direct action to fix the problem), reappraisal (doing the work within—getting one’s own thoughts right and looking for silver linings), and avoidance coping (working to blunt ones emotional reactions by deny­ ing or avoiding the events, or by drinking, drugs, and other distractions). People who have a basic-level trait of optimism (McAdams’s level 1) tend to develop a coping style (McAdams’s level 2 ) that alternates between ac­ tive coping and reappraisal. Because optimists expect their efforts to pay off, they go right to work fixing the problem. But if they fail, they expect that things usually work out for the best, and so they can’t help but look for possible benefits. When they find them, they write a new chapter in their life story (McAdams’slevel 3), a story of continual overcoming and growth. In contrast, people who have a relatively negative affective style (complete with more activity in the front right cortex than the front left) live in a world filled with many more threats and have less confidence that they can deal with them. They develop a coping style that relies more heavily on avoidance and other defense mechanisms. They work harder to manage their pain than to fix their problems, so their problems often get worse. Drawing the lesson that the world is unjust and uncontrollable, and that",571
Page 162,"The Uses ofAdversity 147 things often work out for the worst, they weave this lesson into their life storywhere it contaminates the narrative. If you are a pessimist, you are probably feeling gloomy right now. But despair not! The key to growth is not optimism per se; it is the sense mak­ ing that optimists find easy. If you can find a way to make sense of adver­ sity and draw constructive lessons from it, you can benefit, too. And you can learn to become a sense maker by readingJamie Pennebakers Opening Up.30Pennebaker began his research by studying the relationship between trauma, such as childhood sexual abuse, and later health problems. Trauma and stress are usually bad for people, and Pennebaker thought that self-disclosure—talking with friends or therapists—might help the body at the same time that it helps the mind. One of his early hypotheses was that traumas that carry more shame, such as being raped (as opposed to a non- sexual assault) or losing a spouse to suicide (rather than to a car accident), would produce more illness because people are less likely to talk about such events with others. But the nature of the trauma turned out to be al­ most irrelevant. What mattered was what people did afterward: Those who talked with their friends or with a support group were largely spared the health-damaging effects of trauma. Once Pennebaker had found a correlation between disclosure and health, he took the next step in the scientific process and tried to create health ben­ efits by getting people to disclose their secrets. Pennebaker asked people to write about “the most upsetting or traumatic experience of your entire life,” preferablyone they had not talked about with others in great detail. He gave Ihem plenty of blank paper and asked them to keep writing for fifteen min­ utes, on four consecutive days. Subjects in a control group were asked to write about some other topic (for example, their houses, a typical work day) lor the same amount of time. In each of his studies, Pennebaker got his sub­ jects’permission to obtain their medical records at some point in the future. Then he waited a year and observed how often people in the two groups got sick. The people who wrote about traumas went to the doctor or the hospital lewer times in the following year. I did not believe this result when I first heard it. How on earth could one hour ofwriting stave off the flu sixmonths later? Pennebakers results seemed to support an old-fashioned Freudian no­ lion of catharsis: People who express their emotions, “get it off their chests”",563
Page 163,"148 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s or “let off steam,” are healthier. Having once reviewed the literature on the catharsis hypothesis, I knew that there was no evidence for it .31Letting off steam makes people angrier, not calmer. Pennebaker discovered that its not about steam; it’sabout sense making. The people in his studies who used their writing time tovent got no benefit. The people who showed deep insight into the causes and consequences of the event on their first day of writing g 6t no benefit,-either: They had al­ ready made sense of things. It was the people who made progress across the four days, who showed increasing insight; they were the ones whose health improved over the next year. In later studies, Pennebaker asked people to dance or sing to express their emotions, but these emotionally expressive activities gave no health benefit .32You have to use words, and the words have to help you create a meaningful story. If you can write such a storyyou can reap the benefits of reappraisal (one of the two healthy coping styles) even years after an event. You can close a chapter of your life that was still open, still affecting your thoughts and preventing you from moving on with the larger narrative. Anyone, therefore, can benefit from adversity, although a pessimist will have to take some extra steps, some conscious, rider-initiated steps, to guide the elephant gently in the right direction. The first step is to do what you can, before adversity strikes, to change your cognitive style. If you are a pessimist, consider meditation, cognitive therapy, or even Prozac. All three will make you less subject to negative rumination, more able to guide your thoughts in a positive direction, and therefore more able to withstand fu­ ture adversity, find meaning in it, and grow from it. The second step is to cherish and build your social support network. Having one or two good at­ tachment relationships helps adults as well as children (and rhesus mon­ keys) to face threats. Trusted friends who are good listeners can be a great aid to making sense and finding meaning. Third, religious faith and prac­ tice can aid growth, both by directly fostering sense making (religions provide stories and interpretive schemes for losses and crises) and by in­ creasing social support (religious people have relationships through their religious communities, and many have a relationship with God). A portion of the benefits of religiosit33 could also be a result of the confession and",539
Page 164,"The Uses ofAdversity 149 disclosure of inner turmoil, either to God or to a religious authority that many religions encourage. And finally, no matter how well or poorly prepared you are when trouble strikes, at some point in the months afterwards, pull out a piece of paper and start writing. Pennebaker suggests 34 that you write continuously for fifteen minutes a day, for several days. Don't edit or censor yourself; don’t worry about grammar or sentence structure; just keep writing. Write about what happened, how you feel about it, and why you feel that way. If you hate to write, you can talk into a tape recorder. The crucial thing is to get your thoughts and feelings out without imposing any order on them— but in such a way that, after a few days, some order is likely to emerge on its own. Before you conclude your last session, be sure you have done your best to answer these two questions: Why did this happen? What good might I derive from it? F o r E v e r y t h i n T h e r e Is a S e a s o n If the adversity hypothesis is true, and if the mechanism of benefit has to do with sense making and getting those three levels of personality to co­ here, then there should be times in life when adversity will be more or less beneficial. Perhaps the strong version of the hypothesis is true during only a part of the life course? There are many reasons for thinking that children are particularly vul­ nerable to adversity. Genes guide brain development throughout child­ hood, but that development is also affected by environmental context, and one of the most important contextual factors is the overall level of safety versus threat. Good parenting can help tune up the attachment system to make a child more adventurous; yet, even beyond such effects, if a childs environment feels safe and controllable, the child will (on average) develop a more positive affective style, and will be less anxious as an adul.35But if the environment offers daily uncontrollable threats (from predators, bul­ lies, or random violence), the child’s brain will be altered, set to be less trusting and more vigilant .36 Given that most people in modern Western",458
Page 165,"150 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s nations live in safe worlds where optimism and approach motivations gen­ erally pay off, and given that most people in psychotherapy need loosening up, not tightening up, it is probably best for children to develqp the most positive affective style, or the highest set range (S from chapter 5), that their genes will allow. Major adversity is unlikely to have many—or per­ haps any—beneficial effects for children. (On the other hand, children are amazingly resilient and are not as easily damaged by one-time events, even by sexual abuse, as most people think .37Chronic conditions are much more important.) Of course, children need limits to learn self-control, and they need plenty of failure to learn that success takes hard work and per­ sistence. Children should be protected, but not spoiled. Things might be different for teenagers. Younger children know some stories about themselves, but the active and chronic striving to integrate ones past, present, and future into a coherent narrative begins only in the mid to late teens .38This claim is supported by a curious fact about auto­ biographical memory calledvthe “memory bump.”When people older than thirty are asked to remember the most important or vivid events of their lives, they are disproportionately likely to recall events that occurred be­ tween the ages of fifteen and twenty-five .39This is the age when a persons life blooms—first love, college and intellectual growth, living and perhaps traveling independently—and it is the time when young people (at least in Western countries) make many of the choices that will define their lives. If there is a special period for identify formation, a time when life events are going to have the biggest influence on the rest of the life-story, this is it. So adversity, especially if overcome fully, is probably most beneficial in the late teens and early twenties. We can t ethically conduct experiments that induce trauma at different ages, but in a way life has performed these experiments for us. The major events of the twentieth century—the Great Depression, World War II—hit people at different ages, and the sociologist Glen Elder 40 has produced elegant analyses of longitudinal data (collected from the same people over many decades) to find out why some thrived and others crumbled after these adversities hit. Elder once summarized his findings this way: “There is a storyline across all the work I’ve done. Events do not have meaning in",518
Page 166,"The Uses ofAdversity 151 themselves. Those meanings are derived from the interactions between people, groups, and the experience itself. Kids who went through very diffi­ cult circumstances usually came out rather well .”41Elder found that a lot hinged on the family and the persons degree of social integration: Children as well as adults who weathered crises while embedded within strong so­ cial groups and networks fared much better; they were more likely to come out stronger and mentally healthier than were those who faced adversity without such social support. Social networks didn’t just reduce suffering, they offered avenues for finding meaning and purpose (as Durkheim con­ cluded from his studies of suicide ).42 For example, the widely shared ad­ versity of the Great Depression offered many young people the chance to make a real contribution to their families by finding ajob that brought in a few dollars a week. The need for people to pull together within their na­ tions to fight World War II appears to have made those who lived through it more responsible and civic minded, at least in the United States, even if they played no direct role in the war effor.43 There is, however, a time limit on first adversity. Elder says that life starts to “crystallize” by the late twenties. Even young men who had not been doing well before serving in World War II often turned their lives around afterward, but people who faced their first real life test after the age of thirty (for example, combat in that war, or financial ruin in the Great Depression) were less resilient and less likely to grow from their experi­ ences. So adversity may be most beneficial for people in their late teens and into their twenties. Elders work is full of reminders that the action is in the interactions— that is, the ways, that ones unique personality interacts with details about an event and its social context to produce a particular and often unpre­ dictable outcome. In the area of research known as “life-span develop­ ment ,”44 there are few simple rules in the form of “X causes Y.” Nobody, therefore, can propose an ideal life course with carefully scheduled adver­ sity that would be beneficial for everyone. We can say, however, that for many people, particularly those who overcame adversity in their twenties, adversity made them stronger, better, and even happier than they would have been without it.",498

Even if I could be convinced that a trauma experienced at the age of~twenty-four was going to teach my daughter important lessons and make her a better person, I’d think: Well, why can’t I just teach her those lessons directly? Isn’t there some way she can reap the benefits without the costs? But a common piece of worldly wisdom is that life’smost important lessons can­ not be taught directly. Marcel Proust said: We donot receivewisdom, we must discoverit for ourselves, after ajour­ ney through the wilderness which no one else can make for us, which no one can spare us, for our wisdom is the point of view from which we come at last to regard the worl.45 Recent research on wisdom proves Proust correct. Knowledge comes in two major forms: explicit and tacit. Explicit knowledge is all the facts you know and can consciously report, independent of context. Wherever I am, I know that the capital of Bulgaria is Sofia. Explicit knowledge is taught di­ rectly in schools. The rider gathers it up and files it away, ready for use in later reasoning. But wisdom is based— according to Robert Sternberg ,46a leading wisdom researcher—on “tacit knowledge.”Tacit knowledge is pro­ cedural (it’s“knowing how”rather than “knowing that”), it is acquired with­ out direct help from others, and it is related to goals that a person values. Tacit knowledge resides in the elephant. It’s the skills that the elephant ac­ quires, gradually, from life experience. It depends on context: There is no universal set of best practices for ending a romantic relationship, consoling a friend, or resolving a moral disagreement. Wisdom, says Sternberg, is the tacit knowledge that lets a person balance two sets of things. First, wise people are able to balance their own needs, the needs of others, and the needs of people or things beyond the immedi­ ate interaction (e.g., institutions, the environment, or people who may be adversely affected later on). Ignorant people see everything in black and white—they rely heavily on the myth of pure evil—and they are strongly",520
Page 168,"The Uses ofAdversity 1 53 influenced by their own self-interest. The wise are able to see things from others’points ofview, appreciate shades of gray, and then choose or advise a course of action that works out bfest for everyone in the long run. Second, wise people are able to balance three responses to situations: adaptation (changing the self to fit the environment), shaping (changing the environ­ ment), and selection (choosing to move to a new environment). This second balance corresponds roughly to the famous “serenity prayer”: “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference .”4If you already know this prayer, your rider knows it (explicitly). If you live this prayer, your elephant knows it, too (tacitly), and you are wise. Sternberg’s ideas show why parents can’t teach their children wisdom di­ rectly. The best they can do is provide a range of life experiences that will help their children acquire tacit knowledge in a variety of life domains. Par­ ents can also model wisdom in their own lives and gently encourage children to think about situations, look at other viewpoints, and achieve balance in challenging times. Shelter your children when young, but if the sheltering goes on through the child’s teens and twenties, it may keep out wisdom and growth as well as pain. Suffering often makes people more compassionate, helping them find balance between self and others. Suffering often leads to active coping (Sternberg’s shaping), reappraisal coping (Sternberg’s adapta­ tion), or changes in plans and directions (Sternberg’s selection). Posttrau­ matic growth usually involves, therefore, the growth ofwisdom. The strong version of the adversity hypothesis might be true, but only if we add caveats: For adversity to be maximally beneficial, it should happen at the right time (young adulthood), to the right people (those with the so­ cial and psychological resources to rise to challenges and find benefits), and to the right degree (not so severe as to cause PTSD). Each life course is so unpredictable that we can never know whether a particular setback will be beneficial to a particular person in the long run. But perhaps we do know enough to allow some editing of a child’sforehead writing: Go ahead and erase some of those early traumas, but think twice, or await future re­ search, before erasing the rest.",525

All three set off on epic journeys that make each into an adult, complete with a set of new virtues. These hard-won virtues are especially admirable to us as readers because they reveal a depth and authenticity of character that we dont see in the obedient kid who simply accepts the virtues he was raised with. In this lightr Ben Franklin is supremely admirable. Born in Boston in 1706, he was apprenticed at the age of twelve to his older brother James, who owned aprinting shop. After many disputes with (and beatings from) his brother, he yearned for freedom, but James would not release him from the legal contract of his apprenticeship. So at the age of seventeen, Ben broke the law and skipped town. He got on a boat to New York and, failing to find work there, kept on going to Philadelphia. There he found work as an ap­ prentice printer and, through skill and diligence, eventually opened his own print shop and published his own newspaper. He went on to spectacular suc­ cess in business (Poor Richards Almanack—a compendium of sayings and maxims—was ahit in its day); in science (he proved that lightning is electric­ ity, then tamed it by inventing the lightning rod); in politics (he held too many offices to name); and in diplomacy (he persuaded France to join the American colonies’war against Britain, though France had little to gain from the enterprise). He lived to eighty-four and enjoyed the ride. He tookpride in his scientific discoveries and civic creations; he basked in the love and es­ teem of France as well as ofAmerica; and even as an old man he relished the attentions of women. What was his secret? Virtue. Not the sort of uptight, pleasure-hating Puritanism that some people now associate with that word, but a broader kind of virtue that goes back to ancient Greece. The Greek word arete meant excellence, virtue, or goodness, especially of a functional sort. The arete of a knife is to cut well; the arete of an eye is to see well; the arete of a person is . . . well, thats one of the oldest questions of philosophy: What is the true nature, function, or goal of a person, relative to which we can say that he or she is living well or badly? Thus in saying that well being or hap­ piness (eudaimonia) is “an activity of soul in conformity with excellence or",571
Page 172,"The Felicity ofVirtue 157 virtue,”3Aristotle wasnt saying that happiness comes from giving to the poor and suppressing your sexuality. He was saying that a good life is one where you develop your strengths, realize your potential, and become what it is in your nature to become. (Aristotle believed that all things in the uni­ verse had a telos, or purpose toward which they aimed, even though he did not believe that the gods had designed all things.) One of Franklins many gifts was his extraordinary ability to seepotential and then realize it. He saw the potential ofpaved and lighted streets, volun­ teer fire departments, and public libraries, and he pushed to make them all appear in Philadelphia. He saw the potential of the youngAmerican repub­ lic and played many roles in creatingit. He also saw the potential in himself for improving his ways, and he set out to do so. In his late twenties, as a youngprinter and entrepreneur, he embarked on what he called a “bold and arduous project of arriving at moral perfection.”4He picked a fewvirtues he wanted to cultivate, and he tried to live accordingly. He discovered immedi­ ately the limitations of the rider: While my care was employed in guarding against one fault, I was often surprised by another; habit took the advantage of inattention; inclination was sometimes too strong for reason. I concluded, at length, that the mere speculative conviction that it was our interest to be completelyvir­ tuous was not sufficient to prevent our slipping, and that the contrary habits must be broken, and good ones acquired and established, before we can have any dependence on a steady, uniform rectitude of conduct :5 Franklin was a brilliant intuitive psychologist. He realized that the rider can be successful only to the extent that it trains the elephant (though he did not use those terms), so he devised a training regimen. He wrote out a list of thirteen virtues, each linked to specific behaviors that he should or should not do. (For example: “Temperance: Eat not to dullness”;“Frugality: Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself’; “Chastity: Rarely usevenerybut for health or offspring”). He then printed a table made up of seven columns (one for each day of the week) and thirteen rows (one for each virtue), and he put a black spot in the appropriate square each time",512
Page 173,"158 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s he failed to live a whole day in accordance with a particular virtue. He con­ centrated on only one virtue a week, hoping to keep its row clear of spots while paying no special attention to the other virtues, though he filled in their rows whenever violations occurred. Over thirteen weeks, he worked through the whole table. Then he repeated the process, finding that with repetition the table got less and less spotty. Franklin wrote in his autobiog­ raphy that, though he fell far short of perfection: “I was, by the endeavor, a better and a happier man than I otherwise should have been if I had not at­ tempted it.” He went on: “My posterity should be informed that to this lit­ tle artifice, with the blessing of God, their ancestor ow’d the constant felicity of his life, down to his 79th year, in which this is writt.”6 We can’t know whether, without his virtue table, Franklin would have been any less happy or successful, but we can search for other evidence to test his main psychological claim. This claim, which I will call the “virtue hypothesis,” is the same claim made by Epicurus and the Buddha in the epigraphs that open this chapter: Cultivating virtue will make you happy There are plenty of reasons to doubt the virtue hypothesis. Franklin him­ self admitted that he failed utterly to develop the virtue of humility, yet he reaped great social gains by learning to fake it. Perhaps the virtue hypothe­ sis will turn out to be true only in a cynical, Machiavellian way: Cultivating the appearance of virtue will make you successful, and therefore happy, re­ gardless of your true character. T h e V i r t u e so f t h e A n c i e n t s Ideas have pedigrees, ideas have baggage. When weWesterners think about morality, we use concepts that are thousands of years old, but that took a turn in their development in the last two hundred years. We don’t realize that our approach to morality is odd from the perspective of other cultures, or that it is based on a particular set of psychological assumptions—a set that now appears to be wrong. Every culture is concerned about the moral development of its children, and in every culture that left us more than a few pages of writing, we find texts that reveal its approach to morality. Specific rules and prohibitions vary,",525
Page 174,"The Felicity ofVirtue 159 but the broad outlines of these approaches have a lot in common. Most cul­ tures wrote about virtues that should be cultivated, and many of those virtues were and still are valued across most cultures7 (for example, honesty, justice, courage, benevolence, self-restraint, and respect for authority). Most approaches then specified actions that were good and bad with respect to those virtues. Most approaches were practical, striving to inculcate virtues that would benefit the person who cultivates them. One of the oldest works of direct moral instruction is the Teaching of Amenemope, an Egyptian text thought to have been written around 1300 BCE. It begins by describing itself as “instruction about life” and as a “guide for well-being,” promising that whoever commits its lessons to heart will “discover ... a treasure house of life, and [his] body will flourish upon earth.”Amenemope then offers thirty chapters of advice about how to treat other people, develop self-restraint, and find success and contentment in the process. For example, after repeatedly urging honesty, particularly in respecting the boundary markers of other farmers, the text says: Plow yourfields, and youllfind what you need, Youll receive breadfrom your threshingfloors Better is a bushelgiven you by God Thanfive thousand through wrongdoing. . . . Better is breadwith a happy heart Than wealth with vexation.8 If this last line sounds familiar to you, it is because the biblical book of Proverbs borrowed a lot from Amenemope. For example: “Better is a little with the fear of the Lord than great treasure and trouble with it” ( P r o v e r b s 15 16). An additional common feature is that these ancient texts rely heavily on maxims and role models rather than proofs and logic. Maxims are carefully phrased to produce a flash of insight and approval. Role models are pre­ sented to elicit admiration and awe. When moral instruction triggers emo- Iions, it speaks to the elephant as well as the rider. The wisdom of Confucius and Buddha, for example, comes down to us as lists of aphorisms sotimeless mid evocative that people still read them today for pleasure and guidance,",476
Page 175,"160 Th e H a p p i n e sHsy p o t h e s i s refer to them as “worldwide laws of life ,”9and write books about their scien­ tific validity. A third feature of many ancient texts is that they emphasize practice and habit rather than factual knowledge. Confucius compared moral de­ velopment to learning how to play music ;10both require the study of texts, observance of role models, and many years of practice to develop “virtuos­ ity.”Aristotle used a similar metaphor: Men become builders by building houses, and harpists by playing the harp. Similarly, we growjust by the practice ofjust actions, self-controlled by exercising our self-control, and courageous by performing acts of courage .11 Buddha offered his followers the “Eightfold Noble Path,” a set of activi­ ties that will, with practice, create an ethical person (by right speech, right action, right livelihood), and a mentally disciplined person (by right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration). In all these ways, the ancients reveal a sophisticated understanding of moral psychology, similar to Franklins. They all knew that virtue resides in a well-trained elephant. They all knew that training takes daily practice and a great deal of repetition. The rider must take part in the training, but if moral instruction imparts only explicit knowledge (facts that the rider can state), it will have no effect on the elephant, and therefore little effect on behavior. Moral education must also impart tacit knowledge—skills of social perception and social emotion so finely tuned that one automatically feels the right thing in each situation, knows the right thing to do, and then wants to do it. Morality, for the ancients, was a kind of practical wisdom. H o w t h e W e s t W a s L o s t The Western approach to morality got off to a great start; as in other an­ cient cultures, it focused on virtues. The Old Testament, the New Testa­ ment, Homer, and Aesop all show that our founding cultures relied heavily on proverbs, maxims, fables, and role models to illustrate and teach the",458
Page 176,"The Felicity ofVirtue 161 virtues. Platos Republic and Aristotles Nichomachean Ethicsytwo of the greatest works of Greek philosophy, are essentially treatises on the virtues and their cultivation. Even the Epicureans, who thought pleasure was the goal of life, believed that people needed virtues to cultivate pleasures. Yet contained in these early triumphs of Greek philosophy are the seeds of later failure. First, the Greek mind that gave us moral inquiry also gave us the beginnings of scientific inquiry, the aim of which is to search for the smallest set of laws that can explain the enormous variety of events in the world. Science values parsimony, but virtue theories, with their long lists of virtues, were never parsimonious. How much more satisfying it would be to the scientific mind to have one virtue, principle, or rule from which all others could be derived? Second, the widespread philosophical worship of reason made many philosophers uncomfortable with locating virtue in habits and feelings. Although Plato located most of virtue in the rationality of his charioteer, even he had to concede that virtue required the right passions; he therefore came up with that complicated metaphor in which one of two horses contains some virtue, but the other has none: For Plato and many later thinkers, rationality was a gift from the gods, ,a tool to control our animal lusts. Rationality had to be in charge. These two seeds—the quest for parsimony and the worship of reason— lay dormant in the centuries after the fall of Rome, but they sprouted and bloomed in the European Enlightenment of the eighteenth century. As ad­ vances in technology and commerce began to create a new world, some people began to seek rationally justified social and political arrangements. The French philosopher Rene Descartes, writing in the seventeenth century, was quite happy to rest his ethical system on the benevolence of God, but Enlightenment thinkers sought a foundation for ethics that did not depend on divine revelation or on Gods enforcement. It was as though somebody had offered a prize, like the prizes that lured early aviators to undertake dar­ ingjourneys: Ten thousand pounds sterling to the first philosopherwho can come up with a single moral rule, to be applied through the power ofreason, that can cleanly separate good from bad. Had there been such a prize, it would have gone to the German philoso­ pher Immanuel Kant .12Like Plato, Kant believed that human beings have a dual nature: part animal and part rational. The animal part of us follows",523
Page 177,"162 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s the laws of nature, just as does a falling rock or a lion killing its prey. There is no morality in nature; there is only causality. But the rational part of us, Kant said, can follow a different kind of law: It can respect rules of con­ duct, and so people (but not lions) can be judged morally for the degree to which they respect the right rules. What might those rules be? Here Kant devised the cleverest trick in all moral philosophy. He reasoned -that for moral rules to be laws, they had to be universally applicable. If gravity worked differently for men and women, or for Italians and Egyptians, we could not speak of it as a law. But rather than searching for rules to which all people would in fact agree (a difficult task, likely to produce only a few bland generalities), Kant turned the problem around and said that people should think about whether the rules guiding their own actions could rea­ sonably be proposed as universal laws. If you are planning to break a prom­ ise that has become inconvenient, can you really propose a universal rule that states people ought to break promises that have become inconvenient? Endorsing such a rule would render all promises meaningless. Nor could you consistently will that people cheat, lie, steal, or in any other way de­ prive other people of their rights or their property, for such evils would surely come back to visit you. This simple test, which Kant called the “cat­ egorical imperative,”was extraordinarily powerful. It offered to make ethics a branch of applied logic, thereby giving it the sort of certainty that secular ethics, without recourse to a sacred book, had always found elusive. Over the following decades, the English philosopher Jeremy Bentham challenged Kant for the (hypothetical) prize. When Bentham became a lawyer in 1767, he was appalled by the complexities and inefficiencies of English law. He set out, with typical enlightenment boldness, to re-conceive the entire legal and legislative systemby stating clear goals and proposing the most rational means of achieving those goals. The ultimate goal of all legis­ lation, he concluded, was the good of the people; and the more good, the better. Bentham was the father of utilitarianism, the doctrine that in all deci­ sionmaking (legal and personal), our goal should be the maximum total ben­ efit (utility), but who gets the benefit is of little con.13n The argument between Kant and Bentham has continued ever since. De­ scendants of Kant (known as “deontologists”from the Greekdeon, obligation) try to elaborate the duties and obligations that ethical people must respect,",577
Page 178,"The Felicity of Virtue 163 even when their actions lead to bad outcomes (for example, you must never kill an innocent person, even if doing so will save a hundred lives). Descen­ dants of Bentham (known as “consequentialists” because they evaluate ac­ tions only by their consequences) try to work out the rules and policies that will bring about the greatest good, even when doing sowill sometimes violate other ethical principles (go ahead and kill the one to save the hundred, they say, unless it will set a bad example that leads to later problems). Despite their many differences, however, the two camps agree in impor­ tant ways. They both believe in parsimony: Decisions should be based ul­ timately on one principle only, be it the categorical imperative or the maximization of utility. They both insist that only the rider can make such decisions because moral decision making requires logical reasoning and sometimes even mathematical calculation. They both distrust intuitions and gut feelings, which they see as obstacles to good reasoning. And they both shun the particular in favor of the abstract: You dont need a rich, thick description of the people involved, or of their beliefs and cultural tra­ ditions. Youjust need a few facts and a ranked list of their likes and dislikes (ifyou are a utilitarian). It doesn't matter what country or historical era you are in; it doesn’t matter whether the people involved are your friends, your enemies, or complete strangers. The moral law, like a law of physics, works the same for all people at all times. These two philosophical approaches have made enormous contributions to legal and political theory and practice; indeed, they helped create soci­ eties that respect individual rights (Kant) while still working efficiently for the good of the people (Bentham). But these ideas have also permeated Western culture more generally, where they have had some unintended con­ sequences. The philosopher Edmund Pincoffs 14has argued that consequen­ tialists and deontologists worked together to convince Westerners in the twentieth century that morality is the study of moral quandaries and dilem­ mas. Where the Greeks focused on the characterofa person and asked what kind of person we should each aim to become, modem ethics focuses on ac­ tions, asking when a particular action is right or wrong. Philosophers wrestle with life-and-death dilemmas: Kill one to save five?Allow aborted fetuses to be used as a source of stem cells? Remove the feeding tube from a woman who has been unconscious for fifteen years? Nonphilosophers wrestle with",542
Page 179,"164 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s smaller quandaries: Pay my taxes when others are cheating? Turn in a wallet full ofmoney that appears to belong to a drug dealer? Tell my spouse about a sexual indiscretion? This turn from character ethics to quandary ethics has turned moral ed­ ucation away from virtues and toward moral reasoning. If morality is about dilemmas, then moral education is training in problem solving. Children must be taught how to think about moral problems, especially how to over­ come their natural egoism and take into their calculations the needs of others. As the United States became more ethnically diverse in the 1970s and 1980s, and also more averse to authoritarian methods of education, the idea of teaching specific moral facts and values went out of fashion. In­ stead, the rationalist legacy of quandary ethics gave us teachers and many parents who would enthusiastically endorse this line, from a recent child- rearing handbook: “My approach does not teach children what and what not to do and why, but rather, it teaches them how to think so they can de­ cide for themselves what and what not to do, and why .”15 I believe that this turn from character to quandary was a profound mis­ take, for two reasons* First, it weakens morality and limits its scope. Where the ancients sawvirtue and character at work in everything a person does, our modern conception confines morality to a set of situations that arise for each person only a few times in any given week: tradeoffs between self- interest and the interests of others. In our thin and restricted modern con­ ception, a moral person is one who gives to charity, helps others, plays by the rules, and in general does not put her own self-interest too far ahead of others’. Most of the activities and decisions of life are therefore insulated from moral concern. When morality is reduced to the opposite of self- interest, however, the virtue hypothesis becomes paradoxical: In modern terms, the virtue hypothesis says that acting against your self-interest is in your self-interest. Its hard to convince people that this is true, and it cant possibly be true in all situations. In his time, Ben Franklin had a much eas­ ier taskwhen he extolled the virtue hypothesis. Like the ancients, he had a thicker, richer notion of virtues as a garden of excellences that a person cultivates to become more effective and appealing to others. Seen in this way, virtue is, obviously, its own reward. Franklin’s example implicitly posed this question for his contemporaries and his descendants: Are you",553
Page 180,"The Felicity of Virtue 16 5 willing to work now for your own later well-being, or are you so lazy and short-sighted that you wont make the effort? The second problem with the turn to moral reasoning is that it relies on bad psychology. Many moral education efforts since the 1970s take the rider off of the elephant and train him to solve problems on his own. After being exposed to hours of case studies, classroom discussions about moral dilemmas, and videos about people who faced dilemmas and made the right choices, the child learns how (not what) to think. Then class ends, the rider gets back on the elephant, and nothing changes at recess. Trying to make children behave ethically by teaching them to reason well is like trying to make a dog happy by wagging its tail. It gets causality backwards. During my first year of graduate school at the University of Pennsylvania, I discovered the weakness of moral reasoning in myself. I read a wonderful book—Practical Ethics—by the Princeton philosopher Peter Singer .16Singer, a humane consequentialist, shows how we can apply a consistent concern for the welfare of others to resolve many ethical problems of daily life. Singers approach to the ethics of killing animals changed forever my think­ ing about my food choices. Singer proposes and justifies a few guiding principles: First, it iswrong to cause pain and suffering to any sentient crea­ ture, therefore current factory farming methods are unethical. Second, it is wrong to take the life of a sentient being that has some sense of identity and attachments, therefore killing animals with large brains and highly devel­ oped social lives (such as other primates and most other mammals) is wrong, even if they could be raised in an environment they enjoyed and were then killed painlessly. Singers clear and compelling arguments con­ vinced me on the spot, and since that day I have been morally opposed to all forms offactory farmings Morally opposed, but not behaviorally opposed. I love the taste of meat, and the only thing that changed in the first six months after reading Singer is that I thought about my hypocrisy each time I ordered a hamburger. But then, during my second year of graduate school, I began to study the emotion of disgust, and I worked with Paul Rozin, one of the foremost au­ thorities on the psychology of eating, Rozin and I were trying to find video clips to elicit disgust in the experiments we were planning, and we met one morning with a research assistant who showed us some videos he had",527
Page 181,"166 T h e H a p p i n eHsy p o t h e s i s found. One of them was FacesofDeath, a compilation of real and fake video footage of people being killed. (These scenes were so disturbing that we could not ethically use them.) Along with the videotaped suicides and exe­ cutions, there was a long sequence shot inside a slaughterhouse. I watched in horror as cows, moving down a dripping disassembly line, were bludg­ eoned, hooked, and sliced up. Afterwards, Rozin and I went to lunch to talk about the project. We both ordered vegetarian meals. For days afterwards, the sight of red meat made me queasy. My visceral feelings now matched the beliefs Singer had given me. The elephant now agreed with the rider, and I became a vegetarian. For about three weeks. Gradually, as the disgust faded, fish and chicken reentered my diet. Then red meat did, too, although even now, eighteen years later, I still eat less red meat and choose non­ factory-farmed meats when they are available. That experience taught me an important lesson. I think of myself as a fairly rational person. I found Singers arguments persuasive. But, to para­ phrase Medeas lament (from chapter 1): I sawthe right wayand approved it, but followed the wrong, until an emotion came along to provide some force. T h e V i r t u e so f P o s i t i v P s y c h o l o g y The crythat we've lost our way is heard from some quarter in everycountry and era, but it has been particularly loud in the United States since the so­ cial turmoil of the 1960s and the economic malaise and rising crime of the 1970s. Political conservatives, particularly those who have strong religious beliefs, bridled at the “value-free” approach to moral education and the “empowering"" of children to think for themselves instead of teaching them facts and values to think about. In the 1980s, these conservatives chal­ lenged the education establishment by pushing for character education programs in schools, and by home-schooling their own children. Also in the 1980s, several philosophers helped to revive virtue theories. Most notably, Alasdair MacIntyre argued in After Virtue17that the “enlight­ enment project"" of creating a universal, context-free morality was doomed from the beginning. Cultures that have shared values and rich traditions in­ variably generate a framework in which people can value and evaluate each",541
Page 182,"The Felicity of Virtue 167 other. One can easily talk about the virtues ofa priest, a soldier, a mother, or a merchant in the context of fourth-century BCE Athens. Strip away all iden­ tityandcontext, however, and there is little tograb on to. How much can you sayabout the virtues of a generalized Homo sapiens, floating in space with no particular sex, age, occupation, or culture? The modem requirement that ethics ignore particularity is what gave us our weaker morality—applicable everywhere, but encompassing nowhere. MacIntyre says that the loss of a language ofvirtue, grounded in a particular tradition, makes it difficult for us to find meaning, coherence, and purpose in life .18 In recent years, even psychology has become involved. In 1998, Martin Seligman founded positive psychology when he asserted that psychology had lost its way Psychology had become ohsessed with pathology and the dark side of human nature, blind to all that Was good and noble in people. Seligman noted that psychologists had created an enormous manual, known as the “DSM” (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ofMental Dis­ orders), to diagnose every possible mental illness and behavioral annoy­ ance, but psychology didn't even have a language with which to talk about the upper reaches of human health, talent, and possibility When Seligman launched positive psychology, one of his first goals was to create a diagnos­ tic manual for the strengths and virtues. He and another psychologist, Chris Peterson of the University of Michigan, set out to construct a list of the strengths and virtues, one that might be valid for any human culture. I argued with them that the list did not have to be valid for all cultures to be useful; they should focus just on large-scale industrial societies. Several anthropologists told them that a universal list could never be created. For­ tunately, however, they persevered. As a first step, Peterson and Seligman surveyed every list of virtues they could find, from the holy books of major religions down to the Boy Scout Oath (“trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly . . . ”). They made large tables of virtues and tried to see which ones were common across lists. Although no specific virtue made every list, six broad virtues, or families of related virtues, appeared on nearly all lists: wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and transcendence (the ability to forge connections to some­ thing larger than the self). These virtues are widely endorsed because they are abstract: There are many ways to be wise, or courageous, or humane,",542
Page 183,"168 T h e H a p p i n eHsy p o t h e s i s and it is impossible to find a human culture that rejects all forms of any of these virtues. (Can we even imagine a culture in which parents hope that their children will grow up tol>e foolish, cowardly, and cruel?) But the real value of the list of six is that it serves as an organizing framework for more specific strengths of character. Peterson and Seligman define character strengths as specific ways of displaying, practicing, and cultivating the virtues. Several paths lead to each virtue. People, as well as cultures, vary in the degree to which they value each path. This is the real power of the classification: It points to specific means of growth toward widely valued ends without insisting that any one way is mandatory for all people at all times. The classification is a tool for diagnosing peoples diverse strengths and for helping them find ways to cultivate excellence. Peterson and Seligman suggest that there are twenty-four principle char­ acter strengths, each leading to one of the six higher-level virt.19You can diagnose yourself by looking at the list below or by taking the strengths test (at www.authentichappiness.org). 1. Wisdom: • Curiosity • Love of learning • Judgment ■ • Ingenuity • Emotional intelligence • Perspective 2. Courage: • Valor • Perseverance • Integrity 3. Humanity: • Kindness • Loving 4. Justice: • Citizenship • Fairness • Leadership",311
Page 184,"The Felicity of Virtue 169 5. Temperance: • Self-control • Prudence • Humility 6. Transcendence: • Appreciation of beauty and excellence • Gratitude • Hope • Spirituality • Forgiveness • Humor • Zest Odds are that you don't have much trouble with the list of sixvirtue fami­ lies, but you do have objections to the longer list of strengths. Why is humor a means to transcendence? Why is leadership on the list, but not the virtues of followers and subordinates—duty, respect, and obedience? Please, go ahead and argue. The genius of Peterson and Seligman's classification is to get the conversation going, to propose a specific list of strengths and virtues, and then let the scientific and therapeutic communities work out the details. Just as the DSM is thoroughly revised every ten or fifteen years, the classifi­ cation of strengths and virtues (known among positive psychologists as the “un-DSM”) is sure to be revised and improved in a fewyears. In daring to be specific, in daring to be wrong, Peterson and Seligman have demonstrated ingenuity, leadership, and hope. This classification is already generating exciting research and liberating ideas. Here's my favorite idea: Work on your strengths, not your weaknesses. How many ofyour NewYear's resolutions have been about fixing a flaw?And how many of those resolutions have you made several years in a row? It's dif­ ficult to change.any aspect ofyour personality by sheer force of will, arid if it is a weakness you choose to work on, you probably won't enjoy the process. If you don't find pleasure or reinforcement along the way, then—unless you have the willpower of Ben Franklin—you'll soon give up. But you don't really have to be good at everything. Life offers somany chances to use one tool in­ stead of another, and often you can use a strength to get around a weakness.",414
Page 185,"170 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s In the positive psychologyclass I teach at the UniversityofVirginia, the fi­ nal project is to make yourself a better person, using all the tools of psychol­ ogy, and then prove that you have done so.About half the students each year succeed, and the most successful ones usually either use cognitive behav­ ioral therapy on themselves (it really does work!) or employ a strength, or both. For example, one student lamented her inability to forgive. Her mental life was dominated byruminations about how those to whom she was closest had hurt her. For her project, she drew on her strength of loving: Each time she found herself spiraling down into thoughts about victimhood, she brought to mind apositive memory about the person in question, which trig­ gered a flash of affection. Each flash cut off her anger and freed her, tem­ porarily, from rumination. In time, this effortful mental process became habitual and she became more forgiving (as she demonstrated using the re­ ports she had filled out each day tochart her progress). The rider had trained the elephant with rewards at each step. Another outstanding project was done by a woman who had just under­ gone surgery for brain cancer. At the age of twenty-one, Julia faced no better than even odds of surviving. To deal with her fears, she cultivated one of her strengths—zest. She made lists of the activities going on at the university and of the beautiful hikes and parks in the nearby Blue Ridge Mountains. She shared these lists with the rest of the class, she took time away from her studies to go on these hikes, and she invited friends and classmates to join her. People often say that adversity makes them want to live each day to the fullest, and when Julia made a conscious effort to cultivate her natural strength of zest, she really did it. (She is still full of zest today.) Virtue sounds like hard work, and often is. But when virtues are re­ conceived as excellences, each of which can be achieved by the practice of several strengths pf character, and when the practice of these strengths is often intrinsically rewarding, suddenly the work sounds more like Csik- szentmihalyfs flow and less like toil. Its work that—like Seligman’s de­ scription of gratifications—engages you fully, draws on your strengths, and allows you to lose self-consciousness and immerse yourself in what you are doing. Franklin would be pleased: The virtue hypothesis is alive and well, firmly ensconced in positive psychology.",553
Page 186,"The Felicity of Virtue 171 H a r d Q u e s t i o n, E a s y A n s w e r s Virtue can be its own reward, but thats obvious only for the virtues that one finds rewarding. If your strengths include curiosity or love of learning, you 1 enjoy cultivating wisdom by traveling, going to museums, and attending public lectures. If your strengths include gratitude and appreciation of beauty, the feelings of transcendence you get from contemplating the Grand Canyon will giveyou pleasure too. But it would be naive to think that doing the right thing always feels good. The real test of the virtue hypothesis is to see whether it is true even in our restricted modern understanding of morality as altruism. Forget all that stuff about growth and excellence. Is it true that acting against my self-interest, for the good of others, even when I dont want to, is still good for me? Sages and moralists have always an­ swered with an unqualified yes, but the challenge for science is to qualify* When is it true, and why? Religion and science each begin with an easy and unsatisfying answer, but then move on to more subtle and interesting explanations. For religious sages, the easy way out is to invoke divine reciprocity in the afterlife. Do good, be­ cause God will punish the wicked and reward the virtuous. For Christians, there’s heaven or hell. Hindus have the impersonal workings of karma: The universe will repay you in the next life with a higher or lower rebirth, which will depend upon your virtue in this life. I’m in no position to-say whether God, heaven, or an afterlife exists, but as apsychologist I am entitled to point out that belief in postmortemjustice shows two signs of primitive moral thinking. In the 1920s, the great devel­ opmental psychologist Jean Piaget 20got down on his knees to play marbles and jacks with children and, in the process, mapped out how morality de­ velops. He found that, as children develop an increasingly sophisticated un­ derstanding of right and wrong, they go through a phase in which many rules take on a kind of sacredness and unchangeability. During this phase, children believe in “immanent justice”—justice that is inherent in an act it­ self. In this stage, they think that if they break rules, even accidentally, something bad will happen to them, even if nobody knows about their transgressions. Immanentjustice shows up in adults, too, particularly when",534
Page 187,"172 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s it comes to explaining illness and grave misfortune. A survey 21 of beliefs about the causes of illness across cultures shows that the three most com­ mon explanations are biomedical (referring to physical causes of disease), interpersonal (illness is caused by witchcraft, related to envy and conflict), and moral (illness is caused by ones own past actions, particularly violations of food and sexual taboos). Most Westerners consciously embrace the bio­ medical explanation and reject the other two, yet when illness strikes and Westerners ask, “Why me?” one of the places they often look for answers is to their own past transgressions. The belief that God or fate will dole out re­ wards and punishments for good and bad behavior seems on its face to be a cosmic extension of our childhood belief in immanent justice, which is it­ self a part of our obsession with reciprocity. The second problem with postmortem justice is that it relies on the myth of pure evil.22Each of us can easily divide the world into good and evil, but presumably God would not suffer from the many biases and Machiavellian motivations that make us do so. Moral motivations (justice, honor, loyalty, patriotism) enter into most acts of violence, including terrorism and war. Most people believe their actions are morally justified. A few paragons of evil stand out as candidates for hell, but almost everyone else would end up in limbo. It just wont work to turn God into Santa Claus, a moral account­ ant keeping track of 6 billion accounts, because most lives cant be placed definitively in the naughty or nice columns. The scientific approach to the question also begins with an easy and un­ satisfying answer: Virtue is good for your genes under some circumstances. When “survival of the fittest”came to mean “survival of the fittest gene,”it became easy to see that the fittest genes would motivate kind and coopera­ tive behavior in two scenarios: when it benefited those who bore a copy of those genes (that is, kin), or when it benefited the bearers of the genes directly by helping them reap the surplus of non-zero-sum games using the tit-for-tat strategy. These two processes—kin altruism and reciprocal altruism—do indeed explain nearly all altruism among nonhuman animals, and much of human altruism, too. This answer is unsatisfying, however, because our genes are, to some extent, puppet masters making us want things that are sometimes good for them but bad for us (such as extramari­ tal affairs, or prestige bought at the expense of happiness). We cannot look",569
Page 188,"The Felicity of Virtue 173 to genetic self-interest as a guide either to virtuous or to happy living. Fur­ thermore, anyone who does embrace reciprocal altruism as ajustification for altruism (rather than merely a cause of it) would then be free to pick and choose: Be nice to those who can help you, but don’t waste time or money on anyone else (for example, never leave a tip in restaurants you will not return to). So to evaluate the idea that altruism pays for the altru­ ist, we need to push the sages and the scientists harder: Does it even pay when there is neither postmortem nor reciprocal payback? H a r d Q u e s t i o , H a r d A n s w e r s St. Paul quotes Jesus as having said that “it is more blessed to give than to receive” ( Ac t 2 03 5). One meaning of “bless” is “to confer happiness or prosperity upon .”23Does helping others really confer happiness or prosper­ ity on the helper? I know of no evidence showing that altruists gain money from their altruism, but the evidence suggests that they often gain happi­ ness. People who do volunteer work are happier and healthier than those who don’t; but, as always, we have to contend with the problem of reverse correlation: Congenitally happy people are just plain nicer to begin with ,24 so their volunteer work may be a consequence of their happiness, not a cause. The happiness-as-cause hypothesis received direct support when the psychologist Alice Isen 25 went around Philadelphia leaving dimes in pay phones. The people who used those phones and found the dimes were then more likely to help a person who dropped a stack of papers (carefully timed to coincide with the phone caller’s exit), compared with people who used phones that had empty coin-return slots. Isen has done more random acts of kindness than any other psychologist: She has distributed cookies, hags of candy, and packs of stationery; she has manipulated the outcome of video games (to let people win); and she has shown people happy pictures, always with the same finding: Happy people are kinder and more helpful lhan those in the control group. What we need to find, however, is the reverse effect: that altruistic acts directly cause happiness and/or other long-term benefits. With its exhorta­ tion to “give blood; all you’ll feel is good,”is theAmerican Red Cross telling",523
Page 189,"174 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s the truth? The psychologist Jane Piliavin has studied blood donors in detail and found that, yes, giving blood does indeed make people feel good, and good about themselves. Piliavin 26has reviewed the broader literature on all kinds of volunteer work and reached the conclusion that helping others does help the self, but in complex ways that depend on ones life stage. Re­ search on “service learning,”in which (mostly) high school students do vol­ unteer work and engage in group reflection on what they are doing as part of a course, provides generally encouraging results: reduced delinquency and behavioral problems, increased civic participation, and increased com­ mitment to positive social values. However, these programs do not appear to have much effect on the self-esteem or happiness of the adolescents in­ volved. For adults, the story is a bit different. A longitudinal study 27 that tracked volunteering and well-being over many years in thousands of people was able to show a causal effect: When a person increased volun­ teer work, all measures of happiness and well-being increased (on average) afterwards, for as long as the volunteer work was a part of the persons life. The elderly benefit even more than do other adults, particularly when their volunteer work either involves direct person-to-person helping or is done through areligious organization. The benefits ofvolunteer work for the eld­ erly are so large that they even show up in improved health and longer life. Stephanie Brown and her colleagues at the University of Michigan found striking evidence of such effects when they examined data from a large longitudinal study of older married couples .28 Those who reported giving more help and support to spouses, friends, and relatives went on to live longer than those who gave less (even after controlling for factors such as health at the beginning of the study period), whereas the amount of help that people reported receiving showed no relationship to longevity. Browns finding shows directly that, at least for older people, it really is more blessed to give than to receive. This pattern of age-related change suggests that two of the big benefits of volunteer work are that it brings people together, and it helps them to con­ struct a McAdams-style life story .29Adolescents are already immersed in a dense network of social relationships, and they are just barely beginning to construct their life stories, so they don't much need either of these benefits.",514
Page 190,"The Felicity ofVirtue 175 With age, however, ones story begins to take shape, and altruistic activities add depth and virtue to onescharacter. In old age, when social networks are thinned by the deaths of friends and family, the social benefits of volunteer­ ing are strongest (and indeed, it is the most sociallyisolated elderlywho ben­ efit the most from volunteering ).30 Furthermore, in old age, generativity, relationship, and spiritual strivings come to matter more, but achievement strivings seem out of place,31more appropriate for the middle chapters of a life story; therefore, an activity that lets one 'give something back”fits right into the storyand helps to craft a satisfying conclusion. T h e F u t u r e o f V i r t u e Scientific research supports the virtue hypothesis, even when it is reduced to the claim that altruism is good for you. When it is evaluated in the way that Ben Franklin meant it, $s a claim about virtue more broadly, it be­ comes so profoundly true that it raises the question of whether cultural conservatives are correct in their critique of modern life and its restricted, permissive morality. Should we in the West try to return to a more virtue- based morality? I believe that we have indeed lost something important— a richly tex- tured common ethos with widely shared virtues and values. Just watch movies from the 1930s and 1940s and youll see people moving around in a dense web of moral fibers: Characters are concerned about their honor, their reputation, and the appearance of propriety. Children are frequently disciplined by adults other than their parents. The good guys always win, and crime never pays. It may sound stuffy and constraining to us now, but that’s the point: Some constraint is good for us; absolute freedom is not. Durkheim, the sociologist who found that freedom from social ties is corre­ lated with suicide32also gave us the word ""anomie”(normlessness). Anomie is the condition of a society in which there are no clear rules, norms, or standards of value. In an anomic society, people can do as they please; but without any clear standards or respected social institutions to enforce those standards, it is harder for people to find things they want to do. Anomie",492
Page 191,"176 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s breeds feelings of rootlessness and anxiety and leads to an increase in amoral and antisocial behavior. Modem sociological research strongly sup­ ports Durkheim: One of the best predictors of the health of an American neighborhood is the degree to which adults respond to the misdeeds of other peoples children .33When community standards are enforced, there is constraint and cooperation. When everyone minds his own business and looks the other way, there is freedom and anomie. My colleague at the University of Virginia, the sociologist James Hunter, carries Durkheims ideas forward into the current debate about character education. In his provocative book The Death ofCharacter34Hunter traces out how America lost its older ideas about virtue and character. Before the Industrial Revolution, Americans honored the virtues of ‘producers”—hard work, self-restraint, sacrifice for the future, and sacrifice for the common good. But during the twentieth century, as people became wealthier and the producer society turned gradually into the mass consumption society, an al­ ternative vision of the selfarose— avision centered on the idea of individual preferences and personal fulfillment. The intrinsically moral term “charac­ ter”fell out of favor and was replaced by the amoral term “personality.” Hunter points to a second cause of characters death: inclusiveness. The first American colonists created enclaves of ethnic, religious, and moral homogeneity, but the history of America ever since has been one of in­ creasing diversity. In response, educators have struggled to identify the ever-shrinking set of moral ideas everyone could agree upon. This shrink­ ing reached its logical conclusion in the 1960s with the popular “values clarification” movement, which taught no morality at all. Values clarifica­ tion taught children how to find their own values, and it urged teachers to refrain from imposing values on anyone. Although the goal of inclusiveness was laudable, it had unintended side effects: It cut children off from the soil of tradition, history, and religion that nourished older conceptions of virtue. You can grow vegetables hydroponically, but even then you have to add nutrients to the water. Asking children to grow virtues hydroponically, looking only within themselves for guidance, is like asking each one to in­ vent apersonal language—a pointless and isolating task if there is no com­ munity with whom to speak. (For a sensitive analysis from a more liberal",524
Page 192,"The Felicity ofVirtue 177 perspective of the need for ‘cultural resources” for identity creation, see AnthonyAppiah’sThe Ethics ofIdentity.)35 I believe Hunters analysis is correct, but I am not yet convinced that we are worse off,.overall, with our restricted modern morality. One thing that often distresses me in old movies and television programs, even up through the 1960s, is how limited were the lives of women and African Americans. We have paid a price for our inclusiveness, but we have bought ourselves a more humane society, with greater opportunity for racial minorities, women, gaypeople, the handicapped, and others—that is, for most people. And even if some people think the price was too steep, we can’t go back, either to a pre-consumer society or to ethnically homogeneous enclaves. All we can do is search for ways that we might reduce our anomie without excluding large classes of people. Being neither a sociologist nor an expert in education policy, I will not try to design a radical new approach to moral education. Instead, I will present one finding from my own research on diversity The word “diver­ sity” took on its current role in American discourse only after a 1978 Supreme Court ruling (U.C. Regents v. Bakke) that the use of racial pref­ erences to achieve racial quotas at universities was unconstitutional, but that it was permissible to use racial preferences to increase diversity in the student body Since then, diversity has been widely celebrated, on bumper stickers, in campus diversity days, and in advertisements. For many liber­ als, diversity has become an unquestioned good—like justice, freedom, and happiness, the more diversity, the better. My research on morality, however, spurred me to question it. Given how easyit is to divide people into hostile groups based on trivial differenc,36I wondered whether celebrating diversity might also encourage division, whereas celebrating commonality would help people form cohesive,groups and communities. I quickly realized that there are two main kinds of diversity—demographic and moral. Demographic diversity is about socio- demographic categories such as race, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, age, and handicapped status. Calling for demographic diversity is in large mea­ sure calling for justice, for the inclusion of previously excluded groups. Moral diversity, on the other hand, is essentially what Durkheim described",498
Page 193,"178 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s as anomie: a lack of consensus on moral norms and values. Once you make this distinction, you see that nobody can coherently even want moral diver­ sity. If you are pro-choice on the issue of abortion, would you prefer that there be a wide varietyof opinions and no dominant one? Or would you pre­ fer that everyone agree with you and the laws of the land reflect that agree­ ment? If you prefer diversity on an issue, the issue is not a moral issue for you; it is a matter of personal taste. With my students Holly Horn and Evan Rosenberg, I conducted a study among several groups at the University of Virginia .37We found that there was strong support among students for increasing diversity for demographic categories (such as race, religion, and social class), even among students who described themselves as politically conservative. Moral diversity (opin­ ions about controversial political questions), however, was much less ap­ pealing in most contexts, with the interesting exception of seminar classes. Students wanted to be exposed to moral diversity in class, but not in the people they live with and socialize with. Our conclusion from this study is that diversity is like cholesterol: Theres a good kind and a bad kind, and perhaps we should not be trying to maximize both. Liberals are right towork for a society that is open to people of every demographic group, but conser­ vatives might be right in believing that at the same time we should work much harder to create a common, shared identity Although I am a political liberal, I believe that conservatives have a better understanding of moral de­ velopment (although not of moral psychology in general— they are too com­ mitted to the myth of pure evil). Conservatives want schools to teach lessons that will create a positive and uniquelyAmerican identity, including a heavy dose ofAmerican history and civics, using English as the only na­ tional language. Liberals are justifiably wary of jingoism, nationalism, and the focus on books by “dead white males,” but I think everyone who cares about education should remember that the American motto of e pluribus, unum (from many, one) has two parts. The celebration ofpluribus should be balanced by policies that strengthen the unum. Maybe its too late. Maybe in the hostility of the current culture war, no one can find anyvalue in the ideas of the other side. Or maybe we can turn for instruction to that great moral exemplar, Ben Franklin. Reflecting upon",536
Page 194,"The Felicity ofVirtue 179 the way history is driven forward by people and parties fighting each other bitterly in pursuit of their self-interest, Franklin proposed creating a “United PartyforVirtue.”This party, composed ofpeople who had cultivated virtue in themselves, would act only “with a view to the good of mankind.” Perhaps that was naive even in Franklins day, and it seems unlikely that these “good and wise men” would find it as easy to agree on a platform as Franklin sup­ posed. Nonetheless, Franklin may be right that leadership on virtue can never come from the major political actors; it will have to come from a move­ ment of people, such as the people of a town who come together and agree to create moral coherence across the many areas of childrens lives. Such movements are happening now. The developmental psychologist William Damon 38calls them “youth charter”movements, for theyinvolve the cooper­ ation of all parties to childrearing—parents, teachers, coaches, religious leaders, and the children themselves—who come to consensus on a “char­ ter”describing the community’s shared understandings, obligations, and val­ ues and committing all parties to expect and uphold the same high standards of behavior in all settings. Maybe*youth charter communities can’t rival the moral richness of ancient Athens, but they are doing something to reduce their own anomie while far exceedingAthens injustice.",299

One day, the square is visited by a sphere from a three-dimensional world called Spaceland. When a sphere visits Flatland, however, all that is visible to Flatlanders is the part of the sphere that lies in their plain—in other words, a circle. The square is astonished that the cir­ cle is able to grow or shrink at will (by rising or sinking into the plane of Flatland) and even to disappear and reappear in a different place (by leaving the plane, and then reentering it). The sphere tries to explain the concept of the third dimension to the two-dimensional square, but the square, though skilled at two-dimensional geometry, doesn’t get it. He cannot understand what it means to have thickness in addition to height and breadth, nor can he understand that the circle came from up above him, where “up”does not mean from the north. The sphere presents analogies and geometrical demonstrations of how to move from one dimension to two, and then from two to three, but the square still finds the idea of moving “up” out of the plane of Flatland ridiculous. In desperation, the sphere yanks the square up out of Flatland and into the third dimension so that the square can look down on his world and see it all at once. He can see the inside of all the houses and the guts (insides) of all the inhabitants. The square recalls the experience: An unspeakable horror seizedme. There was darkness; then adizzy, sick­ ening sensation of sight that was not like seeing; I sawspace that was not space: I was myself, and not myself. When I could find voice, I shrieked aloud in agony, “Either this is madness or it is Hell.” “It is neither,” calmly replied the voice of the sphere, “it is Knowledge; it is Three Di­ mensions: open your eye once again and try to look steadily.” I looked, and, behold, anew world! The square is awestruck. He prostrates himself before the sphere and becomes the spheres disciple. Upon his return to Flatland, he struggles to preach the “Gospel of Three Dimensions” to his fellow two-dimensional creatures—but in vain. We are all, in some way, the square before his enlightenment. We have all encountered something we failed to understand, yet smugly believed we un-",530
Page 198,"Divinity With or Without God 183 derstood because we couldn’t conceive of the dimension to which we were blind. Then one day something happens that makes no sense in our two- dimensional world, and we catch our first glimpse of another dimension. In all human cultures, the social world has two clear dimensions: a hori­ zontal dimension of closeness or liking, and avertical one of hierarchy or sta­ tus. People naturally and effortlessly make distinctions along the horizontal dimension between close versus distant kin, and between friends versus strangers. Many languages have one form of address for those who are close (tu, in French) and another for those who are distant (vous). We also have a great deal ofinnate mental structure that prepares us forhierarchical interac­ tions. Even in hunter-gatherer cultures that axe in many ways egalitarian, equality is only maintained by active suppression of ever-present tendencies toward hierarchy .4Many languages use the same verbal methods to mark hi­ erarchyas they do to markcloseness (in French, tu for subordinates as well as friends, vousfor superiors aswell as strangers). Even in languages such as En­ glish that do not have different verb forms for different social relationships, people find a way to mark them anyway: We address people who are distant or superiorbyusing their titles and last names (Mr. Smith, Judge Brown), and use first names for those who are intimate or subordinate .5Our minds auto­ matically keep track of these two dimensions. Think how awkward it was the last time someone you barely knewbut greatlyreveredinvited you to call him by first name. Did the name stick in your throat? Conversely, when a sales­ person addresses you by first name without having been invited to do so, do you feel slighdyoffended? Now imagine yourself happily moving around your two-dimensional social world, a flat land where the X axis is closeness and the Y axis is hier­ archy (see figure 9.1). Then one day, you see aperson do something extraor­ dinary, or you have an overwhelming experience of natural beauty, and you feel lifted “up.” But its not the “up”of hierarchy, its some other kind of ele­ vation. This chapter is about that vertical movement. My claim is that the human mind perceives a third dimension, a specifically moral dimension that I Will call “divinity” (See the Z axis, coming up out of the plane of the page in figure 9.1). In choosing the label “divinity,” I am not assuming that God exists and is there to be perceived. (I myself am a Jewish atheist.) Rather, my research on the moral emotions has led me to conclude that the",573

In reaching this conclusion, I lost the smug contempt for reli­ gion that I felt in my twenties. This chapter, is about the ancient truth that devoutly religious people grasp, and that secular thinkers often do not: that by our actions and our thoughts, we move up and down on a vertical dimension. In the opening epigraph of this chapter, Meng Tzu called it a dimension of noble versus ignoble. Muhammad, like Christians and Jews before him, made it a di­ mension of divinity, with angels above and beasts below. An implication of this truth is that we are impoverished as human beings when we lose sight of this dimension and let our world collapse into two dimensions. But at the other extreme, the effort to create a three-dimensional society and im­ pose it on all residents is the hallmark of religious fundamentalism. Funda­ mentalists, whether Christian, Jewish, Hindu, or Muslim, want to live in nations whose laws are in harmony with— or are taken from—a particular holy book. There are many reasons for democratic Western societies to op­ pose such fundamentalism, but I believe that the first step in such opposi­ tion must be an honest and respectful understanding of its moral motives. I hope that this chapter contributes to such understanding.",329
Page 200,"Divinity With or Without God 185 A r e W e N o t A n i m a l s? I first found divinity in disgust. When I began to study morality, I read the moral codes of many cultures, and the first thing I learned is that most cul­ tures are very concerned about food, sex, menstruation, and the handling of corpses. Because I had always thought morality was about how people treat each other, I dismissed all this stuff about “purity”and “pollution” (as the an­ thropologists call it) as extraneous to real morality. Why are women in many cultures forbidden to enter temples or touch religious artifacts while they are menstruating, or for a few weeks after giving birt? 6It must be some sort of sexist effort to control women. Why is eating pork an abomination for Jews and Muslims? Must be a health-related effort to avoid trichinosis. But as I read further, I began to discern an underlying logic: the logic of disgust. Ac­ cording to the leading theory of disgust in the 1980s, by Paul Rozin,7disgust is largely about animals and the products of animal bodies (few plants or in­ organic materials are disgusting), and disgusting things are contagious by touch. Disgust therefore seemed somehow related to the concerns about an­ imals, body products (blood, excrement), washing, and touch that are so clear in the Old Testament, the Koran, Hindu scriptures, and many ethno­ graphies of traditional societies. When I went to talk to Rozin about the pos­ sible role of disgust in morality and religion, I found that he had been thinking about the same question. With Professor Clark McCauley of Bryn Mawr College, we began to study disgust and the role it plays in social life. Disgust has its evolutionary origins in helping people decide what to eat.8 During the evolutionary transition in which our ancestors’ brains ex­ panded greatly, so did their production of tools and weapons, and so did Iheir consumption of meat .9(Many scientists think these changes were all interrelated, along with the greater interdependence of male and female that I discussed iri chapter 6). But when early humans went for meat, in­ cluding scavenging the carcasses left by other predators, they exposed Ihemselves to a galaxy of new microbes and parasites, most of which are contagious in a way that plant toxins are not: If a poisonous berry brushes up against your baked potato, it wont make the potato harmful or disgust­ ing. Disgust was originally shaped by natural selection as a guardian of the",559
Page 201,"186 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s mouth: It gave an advantage to individuals who went beyond the sensory properties of a potentially edible object (does it smell good?) and thought about where it came from and what it had touched. Animals that routinely eat or crawl on corpses, excrement, or garbage piles (rats, maggots, vul­ tures, cockroaches) trigger disgust in us: We won’t eat them, and anything they have touched becomes contaminated. Were also disgusted by most of the body products of other people, particularly excrement, mucus, and blood, which may transmit diseases among people. Disgust extinguishes desire (hunger) and motivates purifying behaviors such as washing or, if its too late, vomiting. But disgust doesn’t guard just the mouth; its elicitors expanded during biological and cultural evolution so that now it guards the body more gen­ erall.10 Disgust plays a role in sexuality analogous to its role in food selec­ tion by guiding people to the narrow class of culturally acceptable sexual partners and sexual acts. Once again, disgust turns off desire and motivates concerns about purification, separation, and cleansing. Disgust also gives us a queasy feeling when we see people with skin lesions, deformities, am­ putations, extreme obesity or thinness, and other violations of the cultur­ ally ideal outer envelope of the human body. It is the exteriot that matters: Cancer in the lungs or a missing kidney is not disgusting; a tumor on the face or a missing finger is. This expansion, from guardian of the mouth to guardian of the body, makes sense from a purely biological perspective: We humans have always lived in larger, denser groups than most other primates, and we lived on the ground, too, not in trees, so we were more exposed to the ravages of mi­ crobes and parasites that spread by physical contact. Disgust makes us careful about coqtact. But the most fascinating thing about disgust is that it is recruited to support so many of the norms, rituals, and beliefs that cul­ tures use to define themselves . 11For example, many cultures draw a sharp line between humans and animals, insisting that people are somehow above, better than, or more god-like than other animals. The human body is often thought of as a temple that houses divinity within: “Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, which you have from God, and that you are not your own? . . . [T]herefore glorify God in your body” (i Corinthians 6 19-20).",562
Page 202,"Divinity With or Without God 187 Yet a culture that says that humans are not animals, or that the body is a temple, faces a big problem: Our bodies do all the same things that animal bodies do, including eating, defecating, copulating, bleeding, and dying. The overwhelming evidence is that we are animals, and so a culture that re­ jects our animality must go to great lengths to hide the evidence. Biological processes must be carried out in the right way, and disgust is a guardian of that rightness. Imagine visiting a town where people wear no clothes, never bathe, have sex “doggie-style” in public, and eat raw meat by biting off pieces directly from the carcass. Okay, perhaps you’d pay to see such a freak show, but as with all freak shows, you would emerge degraded (literally: brought down). You would feel disgust at this “savage” behavior and know, viscerally, that there was something wrong with these people. Disgust is the guardian of the temple of the body. In this imaginary town, the guardians have been murdered, and the temples have gone to the dogs. The idea that the third dimension—divinity—runs from animals below to god(s) above, with people in the middle, was perfectly captured by the seventeenth-century New England Puritan Cotton Mather, who observed a dog urinating at the same time he himself was urinating. Overwhelmed with disgust at the vileness of his own urination, Mather wrote this resolu­ tion in his diary: ‘Yet I will be a more noble creature; and at the very time when my natural necessities debase me into the condition of the beast, my spirit shall (I say at that very time!) rise and s.”12 If the human body is a temple that sometimes gets dirty, it makes sense that “cleanliness is next to Godliness.”13If you don’t perceive this third di­ mension, then it is not clear why God would care about the amount of dirt on your skin or in your home. But if you do live in a three-dimensional world, then disgust is like Jacob’sladder: It is rooted in the earth, in our bi­ ological necessities, but it leads or guides people toward heaven— or, at least, toward something felt to be, somehow, “up.” T h e E t h i c o f D i v i n i t y After graduate school, I spent two years working with Richard Shweder, a psychological anthropologist at the University of Chicago who is the leading",543
Page 203,"188 Th e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s thinker in the field of cultural psychology. Shweder does much of his re­ search in the Indian city of Bhubaneswar, in the state of Orissa, on the Bay of Bengal. Bhubaneswar is an ancient temple town—its old city grew up around the gigantic and ornate Lingaraj temple, built in the seventh century and still a major pilgrimage center for Hindus. Shweder’sresearch on moral­ ity14in Bhubaneswar and elsewhere shows that when people think about morality, their moral concepts cluster into three groups, which he calls the ethic of autonomy, the ethic of community, and the ethic of divinity. When people think and act using the ethic of autonomy, their goal is to protect in­ dividuals from harm and grant them the maximum degree of autonomy, which they can use to pursue their own goals. WTien people use the ethic of community, their goal is to protect the integrity of groups, families, compa­ nies, or nations, and they value virtues such as obedience, loyalty, and wise leadership. Wlien people use the ethic of divinity, their goal is to protect from degradation the divinity that exists in each person, and they.value liv­ ing in a pure and holy way, free from moral pollutants such as lust, greed, and hatred. Cultures vary in their relative reliance on these three ethics, which correspond, roughly, to the X, Y, and Z axes of figure 9.1. In my dis­ sertation research 15 on moral judgment in Brazil and the United States, I found that educated Americans of high social class relied overwhelmingly on the ethic of autonomy in their moral discourse, whereas Brazilians, and people oflower social class in both countries, made much greater use of the ethics of community and divinity. Tolearn more about the ethic of divinity, I went to Bhubaneswar for three months in 1993, to interview priests, monks, and other experts on Hindu worship and practice. To prepare, I read everything I could about Hinduism and the anthropology ofpurityand pollution, including TheLaws ofManu , 16 a guidebook for Brahmin men (the priestly caste) written in the first or sec­ ond century. Manu tells Brahmins how to live, eat, pray, and interact with other people while still attending to what Cotton Mather called their “natu­ ral necessities/’ In one passage, Manu lists the times when a priest should “not even think about”reciting the holyvedas {scriptures): while expelling urine or excrement, when food is still left on his mouth and hands, while eating at a ceremony for the dead, . . . when one has",592
Page 204,"Divinity With or Without God 189 eaten flesh or the food of a woman who has just given birth,. . . when jackals howl, ... in a cremation ground, . . . while wearing a garment that he has worn in sexual union, while accepting anything at a cere­ mony for the dead, when one has just eaten or has not digested (his food) or has vomited or belched, . . . when blood flows from one’s limbs orwhen one has been woiinded by aweapon. This passage is extraordinary because it lists every category of disgust that Rozin, McCauley, and I had studied: food, body products, animals, sex, death, body envelope violations, and hygiene. Manu is saying that the presence in mind of the holy vedas is not compatible with contamination of the hody from any source of disgust . 1Divinity and disgust must be kept separate at all times. When I arrived in Bhubaneswar, I quickly found that the ethic of divin­ ity is not just ancient history. Even though Bhubaneswar is physically flat, it has a highly variable spiritual topography with peaks at each of its hun­ dreds of temples. As a non-Hindu, I was allowed into the courtyards of temple compounds; and if I removed my shoes and any leather items (leather is polluting), I could usually enter the antechamber of the temple building. I could look into the inkier sanctum where the god was housed, but had I crossed the threshold to join the Brahmin priest within, I would have polluted it and offended everyone. At the highest peak of divinity— the Lingaraj temple itself—I was not even allowed to enter the compound, although foreigners were invited to look in from an observation platform just outside the walls. It was not a matter of secrecy*it was a matter of con­ tamination by people such as me who had not followed the proper proce­ dures of bathing, diet, hygiene, and prayer for maintaining religious purity. Hindu homes in Bhubaneswar have the same concentric structure as the temples: Leave your shoes at the door, socialize in the outer rooms, but never go into the kitchen or the room or area where offerings are made to deities. These two areas are maintained as zones of the highest purity. Even the human body has peaks and valleys, the head and the right hand being pure, the left hand and the feet being polluted. I had to take extraordinary care to keep my feet from touching anyone and to avoid handing something to another person with my left hand. As I moved around Bhubaneswar, I felt",557
Page 205,"190 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s like a square in Spaceland as I tried to navigate a three-dimensional world with only the dimmest perception of its third dimension. The interviews I conducted helped me to see a little better. My goal was to find out whether purity and pollution were reallyjust about keeping bio­ logical “necessities” separate from divinity, or whether these practices had a deeper relationship to virtue and morality. I found a variety of opinions. Some of the less-educated village priests saw the rituals related to purity and pollution as basic rules of the game, things you simply must do because religious tradition demands it. But many of the people I interviewed took a broader view and saw purity and pollution practices as means to an end: spiritual and moral advancement, or moving up on the third dimension. For example, when I asked why it was important to guard ones purity, the head­ master of a Sanskrit school (a school that trains religious scholars) re­ sponded in this way: We ourselves can be gods or demons. It depends on karma. If a person behaves like a demon, for example he kills someone, then that person is trulya demon. A person who behaves in a divine manner, because a per­ son has divinity in him, he is like a god. . . .We should know that we are gods. If we think like gods we become like gods, if we think like demons we become like demons. What is wrong with being like a demon? What is goingon nowadays, it is demonic. Divine behavior means not cheating people, not killing people. Complete character. You have divinity, you are a god. The headmaster, who of course had not read Shweder, gave a perfect statement of the ethic of divinity. Purity is not just about the body, it is about the soul. If you know that you have divinity in you, you will act ac­ cordingly: You will treat people well, and you will treat your body as a tem­ ple. In so doing, you will accumulate good karma, and you will come back in your next life at a higher level—literally higher on the vertical dimension of divinity. If you lose sight of your divinity, you will give in to your baser motives. In so doing, you will accumulate bad karma, and in your next incarnation you will return at a lower level as an animal or a demon. This",520
Page 206,"Divinity With or Without God 191 linkage of virtue, purity, and divinity is not uniquely Indian; Ralph Waldo Emerson said exactly the same thing: He who does a good deed is instantly ennobled. He who does a mean deed is by the action itselfcontracted. He who puts off impurity thereby puts on purity. If a man is at heartjust, then in so far is he.18d S a c r e d In t r u s i o n s When I returned to Flatland (the United States), I didn't have to think about purity and pollution anymore. I didn’t have to think about the second dimension— hierarchy—very much, either. American university culture has only mild hierarchy (students often address professors by first name) compared with most Indian settings. So in some ways my life was reduced to one dimension—closeness, and my behavior was constrained only by the ethic of autonomy, which allowed me to do whatever I wanted, as long as I didn't hurt anyone else. Yet, once I bad learned to see in three dimensions, I saw glimmers of di­ vinity scattered all about. I began to feel disgust for the American practice of marching around ones own house—even ones bedroom—wearing the same shoes that, minutes earlier, had walked through city streets. I adopted the Indian practice of removing my shoes at my door, and asking visitors to do likewise, which made my apartment feel more like a sanctuary, a clean and peaceful space separated more fully than before from the outside world. I noticed that it felt wrong to bring certain books into the bathroom. I no­ ticed that people often spoke about morality using a language of “higher” and “lower.” I became aware of my own subtle feelings upon witnessing people behaving in sleazy or “degraded”ways, feelings that were more than just disapproval; they were feelings of having been brought “down” in some way myself. In my academic work, I discovered that the ethic of divinity had been central to public discourse in the United States until the time of the World War I, after which it began to fade (except in a few places, such as the",450
Page 207,"192 T h e H a p p i n eHsy p o t h e s i s American South—which also maintained racial segregation practices based on notions of physical purity). For example, advice aimed at young people in the Victorian era routinely spoke of purity and pollution. In a widely reprinted book from 1897 titled What a Young Man Ought to Know,19 Sylvanus Stall devoted an entire chapter to “personal purity” in which he noted that God has made no mistake in giving man a strong sexual nature, but any young man makes a fatal mistake if he allows the sexual to dominate, to degrade, and to destroy that which is highest and noblest in his nature. To guard their purity, Stall advised young men to avoid eating pork, mas­ turbating, and reading novels. By the 1936 edition, this entire chapter had been removed. The vertical dimension of divinity was so obvious to people in the Victo­ rian age that even scientists referred to it. In a chemistry textbook from 1867, after describing methods of synthesizing ethyl alcohol, the author felt compelled to warn his young readers that alcohol has the effect of “dulling the intellectual operations and moral instincts; seeming to pervert and destroyall that is pure and holy in man, while it robs him of his highest attribute—reason .”20In his 1892 book promoting Darwins theory of evolu­ tion, Joseph Le Conte, a professor of geology at the University of Califor­ nia at Berkeley, practically quoted Meng Tzu and Muhammad: “Man is possessed of two natures—a lower, in common with animals, and a higher, peculiar to himself. The whole meaning of sin is the humiliating bondage of the higher to the lower.”21 But as science, technology, and the industrial age progressed, the West­ ern world became “desacralized.”At least that’s the argument made by the great historian of religion Mircea Eliade. In The Sacred and the Profane,22 Eliade shows that the perception of sacredness is a human universal. Re­ gardless of their differences, all religions have places (temples, shrines, holy trees), times (holy days, sunrise, solstices), and activities (prayer, spe­ cial dancing) that allow for contact or communication with something oth­ erworldly and pure. To mark off sacredness, air other times, places, and activities are defined as profane (ordinary, not sacred). The borders be­",522
Page 208,"Divinity With or Without God 1 93 tween the sacred and the profane must be carefully guarded, and that’s what rules of purity and pollution are all about. Eliade says that the mod­ ern West is the first culture in human history that has managed to strip time and space of all sacredness and to produce a fully practical, efficient, and profane world. This is the world that religious fundamentalists find unbearable and are sometimes willing to use force to fight against. Eliade’smost compelling point, for me, is that sacredness is so irrepress­ ible that it intrudes repeatedly into the modem profane world in the form of “crypto-religious” behavior. Eliade noted that even a person committed to a profane existence has privileged places, qualitatively different from all others—a rtian’s birth­ place, or the scenes of his first love, or certain places in the first foreign city he visited in his youth. Even for the most frankly nonreligious man, all these places still retain an exceptional, a unique quality; they are the “holy places” of his private universe, as if it were in such spots that he had received the revelation of a reality other than that in which he par­ ticipates through his ordinary daily life. When I read this, I gasped. Eliade had perfectly pegged my feeble spiri­ tuality, limited as it is to places, books, people, and events that have given me moments of uplift and enlightenment. Even atheists have intimations of sacredness, particularly when in love or in nature. We just don’t infer that God caused those feelings. E l e v a t i o a n d A g a p e My time in India did not make me religious, but it did lead to an intellec­ tual awakening. Shortly after moving to the University of Virginia in 1995, I was writing yet another article about how social disgust is triggered when we see people moving “down” on the vertical dimension of divinity. Sud­ denly it occurred to me that I had never really thought about the emotional reaction to seeing people move “up.”I had referred in passing to the feeling of being “uplifted,”but had never even wondered whether “uplift” is a real,",476
Page 209,"194 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s honest-to-goodness emotion. I began to interrogate friends, family, and stu­ dents: “When you see someone do a really good deed, do you feel some­ thing""? What exactly? Where in your body do you feel it? Does it make you want to do anything?”I found that most people had the same feelings I did, and the same difficulty articulating exactly what they were. People talked about an open, warm^or glowing feeling. Some specifically mentioned the heart; others claimed they could not say where in their bodies they felt it, yet even as they were denying a specific location, their hands sometimes made a circular motion in front of the chest, fingers pointing inward as if to indicate something moving in the heart. Some people mentioned feelings of chills, or of choking up. Most said this feeling made them want to per­ form good deeds or become better in some way. Whatever this feeling was, it was beginning to look like an emotion worthy of study. Yet there was no research of any kind on this emotion in the psychological literature, which was focused at the time on the six “basic” emotions 23known-to have dis­ tinctive facial expressions: joy, sadness, fear, anger, disgust, and surprise. If I believed in God, I would believe that he sent me to the University of Virginia for a reason. At U\A, a great deal of crypto-religious activity cen­ ters around Thomas Jefferson, our founder, whose home sits like a temple on a small mountaintop (Monticello) a few miles away. Jefferson wrote the holiest text of American history—the Declaration of Independence. He also wrote thousands of letters, many of which reveal his views on psychol­ ogy, education, and religion. After arriving at UVA, having an Eliade-style crypto-religious experience at Monticello, and committing myself to the cult of Jefferson, I read a collection of his letters. There I found a full and perfect description of the emotion I had just begun thinking about. In 1771, Jefferson’s relative Robert Skipwith asked him for advice on what books to buy for the personal library he hoped to build. Jefferson, who loved giving advice almost as much as he loved books, happily obliged. Jefferson sent along a catalogue of serious works of history and philosophy, but he also recommended the purchase of fiction. In his day (as in Syl- vanus Stalls), plays and novels were not regarded as worthy of a dignified mans time, but Jefferson justified his unorthodox advice by pointing out that great writing can trigger beneficial emotions:",558
Page 210,"Divinity With or Without God 1 95 When any . . . act of charity or of gratitude, for instance, is presented either to our sight or imagination, we are deeply impressed with its beauty and feel a strongdesire in ourselves of doing charitable and grate­ ful acts also. On the contrary, when we see or read ofanyatrocious deed, we are disgusted with its deformity, and conceive an abhorrence of vice. Now every emotion of this kind is an exercise of our virtuous dispo­ sitions, and dispositions of the mind, like limbs of the body, acquire strength by exercise.24 Jefferson went on to say that the physical feelings and motivational ef­ fects caused by great literature are as powerful as those caused by real events. He considered the example of a contemporary French play, asking whether the fidelity and generosity of its hero does not dilate [the readers] breast and elevate his sentiments as much as any similar incident which real history can furnish? Does [the reader] not in fact feel himselfabetter man while reading them, and privately covenant to copy the fair example? This extraordinary statement is more than just a poetic description of the joys of reading. It is also a precise scientific definition of an emotion. In emotion research, we generally study emotions by specifying their compo­ nents, and Jefferson gives us most of the major components: an eliciting or triggering condition (displays of charity, gratitude, or other virtues); physical changes in the body (“dilation”in the chest); a motivation (a desire of “doing charitable and grateful acts also”); and a characteristic feeling beyond bodily sensations (elevated sentiments). Jefferson had described exactly the emo­ tion I hadjust “discovered.”He even said that it was the opposite of disgust. As an act of crypto-religious glorification, I considered calling this emotion “Jefferson’s emotion,” but thought better of it, and chose the word “eleva­ tion,”which Jefferson himself had used to capture the sense of rising on a vertical dimension, away from disgust. For the past seven years I have been studying elevation in the lab. My students and I have used a variety of means to induce elevation and have",460
Page 211,"196 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s found that video clips from documentaries about heroes and altruists, and selections from the Oprah Winfrey show, work well. In most of our studies, we show people in one group an elevating video, while people in the con­ trol condition see avideo designed to amuse them, such as a Jerry Seinfeld monologue. We know (from Alice Isen’s coins and cookies studies )25that feeling happy brings a variety of positive effects, so in our research we al­ ways try to show that elevation is not just a form of happiness. In our most comprehensive study ,26Sara Algoe and I showed videos to research sub­ jects in the lab and had them fill out a recording sheet about what they felt and what they wanted to do. Sara then gave them a stack of blank record­ ing sheets and told them to keep an eye out, for the next three weeks, for instances of someone doing something good for someone else (in the eleva­ tion condition) or for times when they saw someone else tell ajoke (in the amusement/control condition). We also' added a third condition to study nonmoral admiration: People in this condition watched a video about the superhuman abilities of the basketball star Michael Jordan, and were then asked to record times when they witnessed someone doing something un­ usually skillful. Both parts of Saras study show that Jefferson got it exactly right. People really do respond emotionally to acts of moral beauty, and these emotional reactions involve warm or pleasant feelings in the chest and conscious de­ sires to help others or become a better person oneself. A new discovery in Saras study is that moral elevation appears to be different from admiration for nonmoral excellence. Subjects in the admiration condition were more likely to report feeling chills or tingles on their skin, and to report feeling energized or “psyched up.” Witnessing extraordinarily skillful actions gives people the drive and energyto try to copy those actions .27Elevation, in con­ trast, is a calmer feeling, not associated with signs of physiological arousal. This distinction might help explain a puzzle about elevation. Although people say, in all our studies, that theywant to do good deeds, in two studies where wegave them the opportunity to sign up forvolunteer work or to help an experimenter pick up a stack of papers she had dropped, we did not find that elevation made people behave much differently. What sgoing on here? How could an emotion that makes people rise on the dimension of divinity not make them behave more altruistically? Its",549
Page 212,"Divinity With or Without God 197 too soon to know for sure, but a recent finding suggests that love could be the answer. Three undergraduate honors students have worked with me on the physiology of elevation—Chris Oveis, Gary Sherman, and Jen Silvers. WeVe all been intrigued by the frequency with which people who are feel­ ing elevation point to the heart. We believe theyre not just speaking meta­ phorically. Chris and Gary have found hints that the vagus nerve might be activated during elevation. The vagus nerve is the main nerve of the para­ sympathetic nervous system, which calms people down, and undoes the arousal caused by the sympathetic (fight-or-flight) system. The vagus nerve is the main nerve that controls heart rate, and it has a variety of other ef­ fects on the heart and lungs, so if people feel something in the chest, the vagus nerve is the main suspect, and it has already been implicated in research on feelings of gratitude and “appreciation .”28But its difficult to measure the activity of the vagus nerve directly, and so far Chris and Gary have found only hints, not conclusive proof. Nerves have accomplices, however; they sometimes work with hor­ mones to produce long-lasting effects, and the vagus nerve works with the hormone oxytocin to create feelings of calmness, love, and desire for con­ tact that encourage bonding and attachment .29Jen Silvers was interested in the possible role of oxytocin in elevation, but because we did not have the resources to draw blood from subjects before and after watching an el­ evating video (which we’d have to do to detect a change in oxytocin levels), I told Jen to scour the research literature to find an indirect measure— something oxytocin does to people that we could measure without a hypo­ dermic needle. Jen found one: lactation. One of oxytocins many jobs in regulating the attachment of mothers and children is to trigger the release of milk in mothers who breast-feed. In one of the boldest undergraduate honors theses ever done in the UVA psychology department, Jen brought forty-five lactating women into our lab (one at a time), with their babies, and asked them to insert nursing pads into their bras. Half the women then watched an elevating clip from an Oprah Winfrey show (about a musician who, after expressing his gratitude to the music teacher who had saved him from a life of gang violence, finds out that Oprah has brought in some of his own students to express their gratitude to him). The other mothers saw a video clip featuring several",544
Page 213,"198 T h e H a p p i n eHsy p o t h e s i s comedians. The women watched the videos in a private screening room, and a video camera (not hidden) recorded their behavior. When the videos were over, the mothers were left alone with their children for five minutes. At the end of the study, Jen weighed the nursing pads to measure milk re­ lease, and later coded the videos for whether the mothers nursed their ba­ bies or played warmly with them. The effect was one of the biggest I have ever found in any study: Nearly half of the mothers in the elevation condi­ tion either leaked milk or nursed their babies; only a few of the mothers in the comedy condition leaked or nursed. Furthermore, the elevated mothers showed more warmth in the way they touched and cuddled their babies. All of this suggests that oxytocin might be released during moments of elevation. And if this is true, then perhaps it was naive of me to expect that elevation would actually cause people to help strangers (even though they often say they want to do so). Oxytocin causes bonding, not action. Ele­ vation may fill people with feelings of love, trus,30and openness, making them more receptive to new relationships; yet, given their feelings of relax­ ation and passivity, they might be less likely to engage in active altruism to­ ward strangers. The relationship of elevation to love and trust was beautifully expressed in a letter I once received from a man in Massachusetts, David Whitford, who had read about my work on elevation. Whitford’s Unitarian church had asked each of its members to write a spiritual autobiography—an ac­ count of how each had become the spiritual person he or she is now. In one section of his autobiography, Whitford puzzled over why he was so of­ ten moved to tears during church services. He noticed that he shed two kinds of tears in church. The first he called “tears of compassion,” such as the time he cried during a sermon on Mothers’Day on the subject of chil­ dren who were abandoned or neglected. These cases felt to him like “being pricked in the soul,”after which “love pours out”for those who are suffer­ ing. But he called the second kind “tears of celebration”; he could just as well have called them tears of elevation: There’s another kind of tear. This one’s less about giving love and more about thejoyofreceivinglove, ormaybejust detectinglove (whether it’sdi-* rectedat me orat someone else). Its the kind oftearthat flows in response",551
Page 214,"Divinity With or Without God 199 to expressions of courage, or compassion, or kindness by others. A few weeks after Mothers Day, we met here in the sanctuary after the service and considered whether to become a Welcoming Congregation [acongre­ gation that welcomes gaypeople]. When John stood in support of the reso- -lution, and spoke of how, as far as he knew, he was the first gay man to come out at First Parish, in the early 1970s, I cried for his courage. Later, when all hands went up and the resolution'passed unanimously, I cried for the love expressed by our congregation in that act. That was a tear of cele­ bration, a tearofreceptiveness towhat isgoodin the world, atear that says its okay, relax, let down your guard, there are good people in the world, there is good in people, love is real, its in our nature. That kind of tear is alsolikebeingpricked, onlynowthe lovepours in .31 Growing up Jewish in a devoutly Christian country, I was frequently puzzled by references to Christs love and love through Christ. Now that I understand elevation and the third dimension, I think Im beginning to get it. For many people, one of the pleasures of going to church is the experi­ ence of collective elevation. People step out of their everyday profane exis­ tence, which offers only occasional opportunities for movement on the third dimension, and come together with a community of like-hearted people who are also hoping to feel a “lift” from stories about Christ, virtu­ ous people in the Bible, saints, or exemplary members of their own com­ munity. When this happens, people find themselves overflowing with love, but it is not exactly the love that grows out of attachment relationships .32 That love has a specific object, and it turns to pain when the object is gone. This love has no specific object; it is agape. It feels like a love of all humankind, and because humans find it hard to believe that something comes from nothing, it seems natural to attribute the love to Christ, or to the Holy Spirit moving within ones own heart. Such experiences give di­ rect and subjectively compelling evidence that God resides within each person. And once a person knows this ""truth,” the ethic of divinity be­ comes self-evident. Some ways of living are compatible with divinity—they bring out the higher, nobler self; others do not. The split between the Christian left and the Christian right could be, in part, that some people see tolerance and acceptance as part of their nobler selves; others feel that",560

A w e a n d T r a n s c e n d e n c e Virtue is not the only cause of movement on the third dimension. The vast­ ness and beauty of nature similarly stirs the soul. Immanuel Kant explicitly linked morality and nature when he declared that the two causes of gen­ uine awe are ""the starry skyabove and the moral law within .”33Darwin felt spiritually uplifted while exploring South America: In myjournal I wrote that whilst standing in midst of the grandeur of a Brazilian forest, ""it is not possible to give an adequate idea of the higher feelings of wonder, admiration, and devotion which fill and elevate the mind.” I well remember my conviction that there is more in man than the breath of his body.34 The New England transcendentalist movement was based directly on the idea that God is to be found in each person and in nature, so spending time alone in the woods is a way of knowing and worshiping God. Ralph Waldo Emerson, a founder of the movement, wrote: Standing on the bare ground—my head bathed by the blithe air and up­ lifted into infinite space—all mean egotism vanishes. I become a trans­ parent eyeball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or parcel of God. The name of the nearest friend sounds then foreign and accidental; to be brothers, to be acquaintances, master or servant, is then a trifle and a disturbance. I am the lover of uncontained and immortal beauty .35 Something about the vastness and beauty of nature makes the self feel small and insignificant, and anything that shrinks the self creates an oppor­",420

In chapter I, I wrote about the divided self— the many ways in which people feel as though they have multiple selves or intelligences that sometimes conflict. This division is often explained by positing a soul—a higher, noble, spiritual self, which is tied down to a body—a lower, base, carnal self. The soul escapes the body only at death; hut before then, spiritual practices, great sermons, and awe at nature can ^ive the soul a taste of the freedom to come. There are many other ways of getting such a foretaste. People often refer lo viewing great art, hearing a symphony, or listening to an inspiring speaker as (crypto) religious experiences. And some things give more than a taste: They give a full-blown, though temporary, escape. When the hallucinogenic drugs LSD and psilocybin became widely known in the West, medical re­ searchers called these drugs *psychoto-mimetic” because they mimicked some of the symptoms of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. But those who'tried the drugs generally rejected that label and made up terms such as “psychedelic” (manifesting the mind) and “entheogen” (generating God from within). The Aztec word for the psilocybin mushroom was teo- ymnacati, which means literally “gods flesh”; when it was eaten in religious ceremonies, it gave many the experience of a direct encounter with God .36 Drugs that create an altered mental state have an obvious usefulness in marking off sacred experiences from profane, and therefore many drugs, including alcohol and marijuana, play a role in religious rites in some cul­ tures. But there is something special about the phenethylamines— the drug class that includes LSD and psilocybin. Drugs in this class, whether naturally occurring (as in psilocybin, mescaline, or yage) or synthesized by a chemist (I ,SD, ecstasy, DMT) are unmatched in their ability to induce massive alter­ ations of perception and emotion that sometimes feel, even to secular users, like contact with divinity, and that cause people to feel afterwards that theyve been transformed .37The effects ofthese drugs depend greatlyon what Timo- thy Leary and the other early psychedelic explorers called “set and setting,” rt'IVrring to the users mental set, and to the setting in which the drugs are Inkcn. When people bring a reverential mindset and take the drugs in a safe h iI supportive setting, as is done in the initiation rites of some traditional tullures,38these drugs can be catalysts for spiritual and personal growth.",568
Page 217,"202 T h e H a p p i n eHsy p o t h e s i s In the most direct test of this catalyst hypothesis, Walter Pahnke ,39a physician working on a dissertation in theology, brought twenty graduate students in theology into a room below the chapel at Boston University on Good Friday 1962. He gave ten of the students 30 milligrams of psilocy­ bin; the other ten were given identical-looking pills containing vitamin B5 (nicotinic acid), which creates feelings of tingles and flushing on the skin. The vitamin B5 is what’sknown as an active placebo: It creates real bodily feelings, so if the beneficial effects of psilocybin were just placebo effects, the control group would have good reason to show them. Over the next few hours, the whole group listened (via speakers) to the Good Friday service going on in the chapel upstairs. Nobody, not even Pahnke, knew who had taken which pill. But two hours after the pills were taken, there could be no doubt. Those who had taken the placebo were the first to feel some­ thing happening, and they assumed they had gotten the psilocybin. But nothing else happened. Half an hour later, the other students began an ex­ perience that many later described as one of the most important in their lives. Pahnke interviewed them after the drug wore off, and again a week later, and again six months later. He found that most of the people in the psilocybin group reported most of the nine features of mystical experience he had set out to measure. The strongest and most consistent effects in­ cluded feelings of unity with the universe, transcendence of time and space, joy, a difficulty putting the experience into words, and a feeling of having been changed for the better. Many reported seeing beautiful colors and patterns and having profound feelings of ecstasy, fear, and awe. Awe is the emotion of self-transcendence. My friend Dacher Keltner, an expert on emotipn at the University of California at Berkeley, proposed to me a few years ago that we review the literature on awe and try to make sense of it ourselves. We found 40 that scientific psychology had almost nothing to say about awe. It can’t be studied in other animals or created easily in the lab, so it doesn’t lend itself to experimental research. But philosophers, sociologists, and theologians had a great deal to say about it. As we traced the word ""awe” back in history, we discovered that it has al­ ways had a link to fear and submission in the presence of something much greater than the self. It’s only in very modern times—in our de-sacralized world, perhaps—that awe has been reduced to surprise plus approval, and",579
Page 218,"Divinity With or Without God 203 Ihe word “awesome,” much used by American teenagers, has come to mean little more than ""double-plus good” (to use George Orwells term I'rom 1984). Keltner and I concluded that the emotion of awe happens when two conditions are met: a person perceives something vast (usually physicallyvast, but sometimes conceptuallyvast, such as a grand theory; or sociallyvast, such as great fame or power); and the vast thing cannot be ac­ commodated by the persons existing mental structures. Something enor­ mous cant be processed, and when people are stumped, stopped in their cognitive tracks while in the presence of something vast, they feel small, powerless, passive, and receptive. They often (though not always) feel fear, admiration, elevation, or a sense of beauty as well. By stopping people and making them receptive, awe creates an opening for change, and this is why awe plays a role in most stories of religious conversion. We found a prototype of awe—a perfect but extreme case—in the dra­ matic climax of the Bhagavad Gita. The Gita is an episode within the much longer story of the Mahabharata, an epic work about a war between two branches of an Indian royal family. As the hero of the story, Arjuna, is about to lead his troops into battle, he loses his nerve and refuses to fight. He does not want to lead his kinsmen into slaughter against his kinsmen. The Gita is the storyof how Krishna (a form ofthe godVishnu) persuadesAijuna that he must lead his troops into battle. In the middle of the battlefield, with troops arrayed on both sides, Krishna gives a detailed and abstract theological lec- ture on the topic of dharma—the moral law of the universe. Aijuna sdharma requires that he fight and win this war. Not surprisingly (given the weakness of reason when it comes to motivating action), Arjuna is unmoved. Aijuna asks Krishna to show him this universe of which he speaks. Krishna grants Arjunas request and gives him a cosmic eye that allows him to see God and the universe as they really are. Aijuna then has an experience that sounds to modern readers like an LSD trip. He sees suns, gods, and infinite time. He is IIIled with amazement. His hair stands on end. He is disoriented and con­ fused, unable to comprehend the wonders he is seeing. I don’t know whether I'.dwin Abbot read the Bhagavad Gita, but the squares experience in Space- land is exactly likeArjuna’s.Arjuna is clearly in a state of awe when he says, ""Things never before seen have I seen, and ecstatic is my joy; yet fear-and- hnnbling perturb my mind .”4When the cosmic eye is removed andAijuna",620
Page 219,"2 0 4 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s comes “down”from his trip, he does just what the square did: He prostrates himself before the God who enlightened him, and he begs to serve. Krishna commandsArjuna tobe loyal to him, and to cut offall other attachments. Ar­ juna gladlyobeys, and, from then on, he honors Krishnas commands. Aijunas experience is extreme—the stuff of scripture; yet many people have had a spiritually transformative experience that included many of the same elements. In what is still the greatest work on the psychology of reli­ gion, William James analyzed the Varieties of religious experience ,”42in­ cluding rapid and gradual religious conversions and experiences with dru^s and nature. James found such extraordinary similarity in the reports of these experiences that he thought theyrevealed deep psychological truths. One of the deepest truths, James said, was that we experience life as a divided self, torn by conflicting desires. Religious experiences are real and common, whether or not God exists, and these experiences often make people feel whole and at peace. In the rapid type of conversion experience (such as those ofAijuna and the square), the old self, full of petty concerns, doubts, and grasping attachments, is washed away in an instant, usually an instant ofprofound awe. People feel reborn and often remember the exact time and place of this rebirth, the moment they surrendered their will to a higher power and were granted direct experience of deeper truth. After such re­ birth, fear and worry are greatly diminished and the world seems clean, new, and bright. The self is changed in ways that any priest, rabbi, or psy­ chotherapist would call miraculous. James described these changes: The man who lives in his religious centre of personal energy, and is actu­ ated by spiritual enthusiasms, differs from his previous carnal self in per­ fectlydefinite ways. The newardorwhich bums in his breast consumes in its glow the lower “noes” which formerly beset him, and keeps him im­ mune against infection from the entire groveling portion of his nature. Magnanimities once impossible are now easy; paltryconventionalities and mean incentives once tyrannical hold no sway. The stone wall inside of him has fallen, the hardness in his heart has broken down. The rest of us can, I think, imagine this by recalling our state of feeling in those tempo­ rary“melting moods”into which either the trials ofreal life, or the theatre, or a novel sometimes throw us. Especially if we weep! For it is then as if",575
Page 220,"Divinity With or Without God 205 our tearsbroke throughan inveterateinner dam, and let all sortsofancient peccancies and moral stagnancies drain away, leaving us now washed and soft ofheart and open toeverynobler leading.43 James’s “melting moods” are strikingly similar to the feelings of elevation described byJefferson and by David Whitford. Atheists may protest that they, too, can have many of the same experi­ ences without God. The psychologist who took such secular experiences se­ riously was Abraham Maslow, Harry Harlow’s first graduate student and a founder of humanistic psychology. Maslow collected reports of what he called “peak experiences”—those extraordinary self-transcendent moments that feel qualitatively different from ordinary life. In a small gem of a book, Religions, Values, and PeakExperiences,44 Maslow listed twenty-five common features of peak experiences, nearly all of which can be found somewhere in William James. Here are some: The universe is perceived as a unified whole where everything is accepted and nothing is judged or ranked; egocentrism nnd goal-striving disappear as a person feels merged with the universe (and often with God); perceptions of time and space are altered; and the person is flooded with feelings ofwonder, awe,joy, love, and gratitude. Maslow’s goal was to demonstrate that spiritual life has a naturalistic meaning, that peak experiences are abasic fact about the human mind. In all eras and all cultures, many people have had these experiences, and Maslow suggested that all religions are based on the insights of somebody's peak ex­ perience. Peak experiences make people nobler, just as Janies had said, and religions were created as methods of promoting peak experiences and then maximizing their ennobling powers. Religions sometimes lose touch with (heir origins, however; they are sometimes taken over by people who have not had peak experiences—the bureaucrats and company men who want to routinize procedures and guard orthodoxyfor orthodoxy’ssake. This, Maslow sjiid, is why many young people became disenchanted with organized reli­ gion in the mid-twentieth-century, searching instead for peak experiences in psychedelic drugs, Eastern religions, and new forms of Christian worship. Maslow’s analysis probably does not shock you. It makes sense as a secular psychological explanation of religion. But what is most surprising m Religions, Values, and Peak Experiences is Maslow’sattack on science for",527
Page 221,"206 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s becoming as sterile as organized religion. The historians of science Lorraine Daston and Katherine Park 45 later documented this change. They showed that scientists and philosophers had traditionally held an attitude of wonder toward the natural world and the objects of their inquiry. But in the late six­ teenth century, European scientists began to look down on wonder; they be­ gan to see it as the mark of a childish mind, whereas the mature scientist went about coolly cataloging the laws of the world. Scientists may tell us in their memoirs about their private sense of wonder, but the everyday world of the scientist is one that rigidly separates facts from values and emotions. Maslow echoed Eliade in claiming that science has helped to de-sacralize the world, that it is devoted to documenting only what is, rather than what isgood orwhat is beautiful One might object that there is an academic divi­ sion of labor; the good and the beautiful are the province of the humanities, not of the sciences. Maslow charged, however, that the humanities had ab­ dicated their responsibility with their retreat to relativism, their skepticism about the possibility of truth, and their preference for novelty and icono- clasm over beauty. He founded humanistic psychology in part to feed the widespread hunger for knowledge about values and to investigate the sort of truth people glimpse in peak experiences. Maslow did not believe religions were literally true (as actual accounts of God and creation), but he thought they were based on the most important truths of life, and he wanted to unite those truths-with the truths of science. His goal was nothing less than the reformation of education and, therefore, of society: “Education must be seen as at least partially an effort to produce the good human being, to fos­ ter the good life and the good society.”46 T h e S a t a n i c S e l f The self is one of the great paradoxes of human evolution. Like the fire stolen by Prometheus, it made us powerful but exacted a cost. In The Curse of the Self47the social psychologist Mark Leary points out that many other animals can think, but none, so far as we know, spend much time thinking about themselves. Only a few other primates (and perhaps dolphins) can",492
Page 222,"Divinity With or Without God 207 even learn that the image in a mirror belongs to them .48Only a creature with language ability has the mental apparatus to focus attention on the self, to Ihink about the self’sinvisible attributes and long term goals, to create a nar­ rative about that self, and then to react emotionally to thoughts about that narrative. Leary suggests that this ability to create a self gave our ancestors many useful skills, such as long-term planning, conscious decision making and self-control, and the ability to see other people’s perspectives. Because these skills are all important for enabling human beings to work closely to­ gether on large projects, the development of the self may have been crucial lo the development of human ultrasociality. But by giving each one of us an inner world, aworld full of simulations, social comparisons, and reputational concerns, the self also gave each one of us a personal tormenter. We all now live amid a whirlpool of inner chatter, much of which is negative (threats loom larger than opportunities), and most of which is useless. It is important to note that the selfis not exactly the rider—much of the selfis unconscious and automatic—but because the self emerges from conscious verbal think­ ing and storytelling, it can be constructed only by the rider. Leary’s analysis shows why the self is a problem for all major religions: The self is the main obstacle to spiritual advancement, in three ways. First, the constant stream of trivial concerns and egocentric thoughts keeps people locked in the material and profane world, unable to perceive sacredness and divinity. This is why Eastern religions relyheavily on meditation, an effective means of quieting the chatter of the self. Second, spiritual transformation is essentially the transformation of the self, weakening it, pruning it back—in some sense, killing it—and often the self objects. Give up my possessions and the prestige they bring? No way! Love my enemies, after what they did lo me? Forget about it. And third, following a spiritual path is invariably hard work, requiring years of meditation, prayer, self-control, and sometimes self- denial. The self does not like to be denied, and it is adept at finding reasons (o bend the rules or cheat. Many religions teach that egoistic attachments to pleasure and reputation are constant temptations to leave the path of virtue. Ina sense, the selfis Satan, or, at least, Satan’sportal. For all these reasons, the self is a problem for the ethic of divinity. The hig greedy self is like a brick holding down the soul. Only by seeing the self",547

Bush re­ ceived a majority of the votes in the U.S. presidential election of 2004, 49 percent of Americans had a lot of coping to do. Many people in the “blue states” (those where a majority voted for John Kerry, shown on all electoral maps in blue) could not understand why people in the “red states” sup­ ported Bush and his policies. Liberals posted maps of the United States on the Internet that showed the blue states (all in the Northeast, the upper Midwest, and along the West coast) labeled “United States of America”; the red states (almost the whole interior and south of the nation) were la­ beled “Jesusland.” Conservatives countered with their own map in which the blue states were labeled “New France,” but I think a more accurate parody, from the rights point of view, might have been to call the blue states “Selfland.” I am not suggesting that people who voted for John Kerry are any more selfish than those who voted for George Bush—indeed, the taxation and so­ cial policies of the twocandidates suggestjust the opposite. But I am trying to understand the mutual incomprehension of the two sides in the culture war, and I believe that Shweders three ethics—particularly the ethic of divinity—are the key to it. Which of the following quotations inspires you more: ( 1 ) “Self-esteem is the basis of any democracy”; ( 2) “Its not all about you.”The first is attrib­ uted to Gloria Steinem ,49a founder of the feminist movement in the 1970s. It claims that sexism, racism, and oppression make particular groups of people feel unworthy and therefore undermine their participation in de­ mocracy. This quote also reflects the core idea of the ethic of autonomy: In­ dividuals are what really matter in life, so the ideal society protects all individuals from harm and respects their autonomy and freedom of choice. The ethic of autonomy is well suited to helping people with different back­",519
Page 224,"Divinity With or Without God 209 grounds and values get along with each other because it allows each person to pursue the life she chooses, as long as those choice^ don't interfere with (he rights of others. The second quote is the opening line of the worlds biggest-selling book in 2003 and 2004, The Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren ,50a guide for finding purpose and meaning through faith in Jesus Christ and the revela- Iion of the Bible. From Warrens perspective, the self is the cause of our problems and therefore efforts to raise childrens self-esteem directly with iiwards, praise, and exercises to make them feel “special”are positively evil. The core idea of the ethic of divinity is that each person has divinity inside, so the ideal society helps people live in a way consistent with that divinity. What an individual desires is not particularly important— many desires come from the carnal self. Schools, families, and the media should all work together to help children overcome their sense of self and entitlement and live instead in the way Christ intended. Many of the keybattles in theAmerican culture war are essentially about whether some aspect of life should be structured by the ethic of autonomy or by the ethic of divini.51(The ethic of community, which stresses the im­ portance of the group over that of the individual, tends to be allied with the cthic of divinity). Should there4>eprayer in schools? Should the Ten Com­ mandments be posted in schools and courthouses? Should the phrase “un­ der God”be struck from theAmerican pledge of allegiance? Liberals usually want to keep religion out of public life so that people cannot be forced to participate against their will, but religious conservatives want schools and courthouses re-sacralized. They want their children to live in a (particular) three-dimensional world, and if the schools wont provide it, they some­ times turn to home-schooling instead. Should people be allowed to use birth control, abortion, reproductive technologies, and assisted suicide as they please? It depends on whether your goal is to empower people to manage some of the most important choices of their lives, orwhether you think all such decisions must be made by God. If the book title Our Bodies, Ourselves sounds like a noble act of de- fInnee toyou, you will support peoples rights to choose their own sexual ac­ tivities and to modify their bodies as they please. But if you believe that ""(Joel prescribed every single detail of your bod,”52as Warren writes in The",536
Page 225,"210 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s Purpose Driven Life, you will probably be offended by sexual diversity and by body modifications such as piercings and plastic surgery. My students and I have interviewed political liberals and conservatives about sexual morality,53and about body modifications ,54and in both studies we found that liberals were much more permissive and relied overwhelmingly on the ethic of autonomy; conservatives, much more critical, used all three ethics in their discourse. For example, one conservative man justified his condem­ nation of a story about an unusual form of masturbation: Its a sin because it distances ourselves from God. Its a pleasure that God did not design for us to enjoy because sexual pleasures, through, you know, a married heterosexual couple, were designed by God in order to reproduce.55 On issue after issue, liberals want to maximize autonomy by removing limits, barriers, and restrictions. The religious right, on the other hand, wants to structure personal, social, and political relationships in three dimensions and so create a landscape of purity and pollution where restrictions maintain the separation of the sacred and the profane. For the religious right, hell on earth is a flat land of unlimited freedom where selves roam around with no higher purpose than expressing and developing themselves. As a liberal, I value tolerance and openness to new ideas. I have done my best, in this chapter, to be tolerant toward those whose politics I oppose and to find merit in religious ideas I do not hold. But although I have be­ gun to see the richness that divinity adds to human experience, I do not entirely lament the “flattening” of life in the West over the last few hun­ dred years. An unfortunate tendency of three-dimensional societies is that they often include one or more groups that get pushed down on the third dimension and then treated badly, or worse. Look at the conditions of “un­ touchables”in India until recently, or at the plight of Jews in medieval Eu­ rope and in purity-obslessed Nazi Germany, or at the humiliation ofAfrican Americans in the segregated South. The American religious right now",442
Page 226,"Divinity With or Without God 211 seems to be trying to push homosexuals down in a similar way. Liberalism and the ethic of autonomy are great protectors against such injustices. I believe it is dangerous for the ethic of divinity to supersede the ethic of autonomy, in the governance of a diverse modem democracy. However, I also believe that life in a society that entirely ignored the ethic of divinity would be ugly and unsatisfying. Because the culture war is ideological, both sides use the myth of pure evil. To acknowledge that the other side might be right about anything is an act of treason. My research on the third dimension, however, has freed me Irom the myth and made it easyfor me to think treasonous thoughts. Here’s one: If the third dimension and perceptions of sacredness are an important part of human nature, then the scientific community should accept religios­ ity as a normal and healthy aspect of human nature—an aspect that is as deep, important, and interesting as sexuality or language (which we study intensely). Here’s another treasonous thought: If religious people are right in believing that religion is the source of their greatest happiness, then maybe the rest of us who are looking for happiness and meaning can learn something from them, whether or not we believe in God. That’s the topic of Ihe final chapter.",279

For the graduating class of 1981 n( Scarsdale High School, in Scarsdale, New York, choosing a quotation was a rite of passage, an opportunity to reflect on ones emerging identity and express some aspect of it. As I look through the yearbook from that i’lass, at the quotations underneath each photo, I see two main kinds. Many are tributes to love and friendship, appropriate for a time of parting from friends (“You never really leave the friends you love. Part of them you 213",282
Page 229,"214 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s take with you, leaving a part of you behind.” [An o n y m o ]).The other kind expresses optimism, sometimes mixed with trepidation, about the road ahead. Indeed, it is difficult to think about graduating from high school without using the metaphor that life is ajourney. For example, four students quoted the Cat Stevens song “On the Road to Find Out .”3Two quoted George Washington: “I am embarked on a wide ocean, boundless in its prospect and, in which, perhaps, no safe harbor is to be found .”4And one student quoted this line from Bruce Springsteen: “Well I got some beer and the highways free / and I got you, and baby youVe got me .”5 But nestled among these affirmations of lifes limitless possibilities is one with a darker tone: “Whosoever shall not fall by the sword or by famine, shall fall by pestilence so why bother shaving?” (W o od y A l l e).6Above those words is a photograph of me. I was only partly kidding. During the previous year, I had written a paper examining the play Waitingfor Godot, Samuel Becketts existentialist medita­ tion on the absurdity of life in aworld with no God, and it got me thinking. I was already an atheist, and by my senior year I had became obsessed with the question “What is the meaning of life?” I wrote my personal statement for college admissions on the meaninglessness of life. I spent the winter of my senior year in a kind of philosophical depression—not a clinical depres­ sion, just a pervasive sense that everything was pointless. In the grand scheme of things, I thought, it really didn’t matter whether I got into college, or whether the Earth was destroyed by an asteroid or by nuclear war. My despair was particularly strange because, for the first time since the age of four, my life was perfect. I had a wonderful girlfriend, great friends, and loving parents. I was captain of the track team, and, perhaps most im­ portant for a seventeen-year-old boy, I got to drive around in my fathers 1966 Thunderbird convertible. Yet I kept wondering why any of it mat­ tered. Like the author of Ecclesiastes, I thought that “all is vanity and a chasing after wind” (Ec c l e s ia s 1:1 ). I finally escaped when, after a week of thinking about suicide (in the ab­ stract, not as a plan), I turned the problem inside out. There is no God and no externally given meaning to life, I thought, so from one perspective it really wouldn’t matter if I killed myself tomorrow. Very well, then every-",587
Page 230,"Happiness Comesfrom Between 215 ihing beyond tomorrow is a gift with no strings and no expectations. There is no test to hand in at the end of life, so there is no way to fail. If this really is all there is, why not embrace it, rather than throw it away? I dont know whether this realization lifted my mood or whether an improving mood helped me to reframe the problem with hope; but my existential depres­ sion lifted and I enjoyed the last months of high school. My interest in the meaning of life continued, however, so in college I ma­ jored in philosophy, where I found few answers. Modern philosophers spe­ cialize in analyzing the meaning of words, but, aside from the existentialists (who caused the problem for me in the first place), they had little to say about the meaning of life. It was only after I entered graduate school in psy­ chology that I realized why modem philosophy seemed sterile: It lacked a deep understanding of human nature. The ancient philosophers were often good psychologists, as I have shown in this book, but when modern philoso­ phy began to devote itself to the study of logic and rationality, it gradually lost interest in psychology and lost touch with the passionate, contextualized na- Ilire of human life. It is impossible to analyze “the meaning of life”in the ab­ stract, or in general, or for some mythical and perfectly rational bein.7Only by knowing the kinds of beings that we actually are, with the complex mental and emotional architecture that we happen to possess, can anyone even be­ gin to ask about what would count as a meaningful life. (Philosophy has, to its credit, become more psychological and more passionate in recent years .)8 As I went on in psychology and in my own research on morality, I dis­ covered that psychology and related sciences have revealed so much about human nature that an answer is now possible. In fact, weve known most of the answer for a hundred years, and many of the remaining pieces have fallen into place over the last ten. This chapter is my version of psychol­ ogy's answer to the ultimate question. W h a t W a s t h e Q u e s t i o n? The question “What is the meaning of life”might be called the Holy Ques- tion, in analogy to the Holy Grail: Its pursuit is noble and everyone should",506
Page 231,"216 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s want to find an answer, yet few people expect that one can be found. That’s why books and movies that purport to tell us the answer to the Holy Ques­ tion often do so only in jest. In The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy; a gi­ gantic computer built to answer the Holy Question spits out its solution after 7.5 million years of computation: “forty-two .”9In the closing scene of the movie Monty Pythons The Meaning of Life, the answer to the Holy Question is handed to the actor Michael Palin (in drag), who reads it aloud: “Try to be nice to people, avoid eating fat, read a good book every now and then, get some walking in, and try to live in harmony with people of all creeds and nations .”10These answers are funny precisely because they take theform of good answers, yet their content is empty or mundane. These par­ odies invite us to laugh at ourselves and ask: What was I expecting? What kind of answer could have satisfied me? One thing philosophy did teach me is how to analyze questions, how to clarify exactlywhat is being asked before giving an answer. The Holy Ques­ tion cries out for clarification. Whenever we ask “What is the meaning of X?”what kind of answer could possibly satisfy us? The most common kind of meaning is definitional. “What is the meaning of ananym’?”means “Define the word ananym’for me so that I can under­ stand it when I read it.” I go to a dictionary, 1look it up, and find that it means “a pseudonym cpnsisting of the real name written backwards.”Very well, what is the meaning of “life”? I go back to the dictionary and find that life has twenty-one meanings, including “the quality that distinguishes avital and functional being from a dead body or purely chemical matter” and “the period from birth to death.” Dead end. This is not at all the right kind of an­ swer. We are not asking about the word “life,”we’re asking about life itself. A second kind of meaning is about symbolism or substitution. If you dream about exploring a basement and finding a trap door to a subbase­ ment, you might ask, “What is the meaning of the subbasement?”The psy­ chologist Carl Jung had such a dream 12and concluded that the meaning of the subbasement—the thing it symbolized or stood for—was the collective unconscious, a deep set of ideas shared by all people. But this is another dead end. Life does not symbolize, stand for, or point to anything. It is life itself that we want to understand.",590
Page 232,"Happiness Comesfrom Between 217 A third way in which we ask about meaning is as a plea for help in mak­ ing sense of something, usually with reference to peoples intentions and beliefs. Suppose you walk into a movie half an hour late and have to leave haIFan hour before the end. Later that night you are talking with a friend who saw the whole film and you ask, “What did it mean when the guy with Ihe curly hair winked at that kid?”You are aware that the act had some sig­ nificance for the plot of the movie, and you suspect that you need to know certain facts to understand that act. Perhaps a prior relationship between Ihe two characters had been revealed in the opening scenes? To ask, “What was the meaning of the wink?” really means, “What do I need to know to understand that wink?” Now were making progress, for life is much like a movie we walk into well after its opening scene, and we will have to step out long before most of the story lines reach their conclusions. We are acutely aware that we need to know a great deal if we are to understand Ihe few confusing minutes that we do watch. Of course, we don’t know ex­ actlywhat it is that we don’t know, sowe can’t frame the question well. We ask, “What is the meaning of life?” not expecting a direct answer (such as ""forty-two”), but rather hoping for some enlightenment, something to give us an “aha!” experience in which, suddenly, things that we had not before understood or recognized as important begin to make sense (as they did for the square taken to the third dimension). Once the Holy Question has been re-framed to mean “Tell me some­ thing enlightening about life,”the answer must involve the kinds of revela­ tions that human beings find enlightening. There appear to be two specific sub-questions to which people want answers, and for which they find an­ swers enlightening. The first can be called the question of the purpose of life: “What is the purposefor which human beings were placed on Earth? Why are we here?”There are two major classes of answers to this question: I'lither you believe in a god/spirit/intelligence who had some idea, desire, or intention in creating the world or you believe in a purely material world in which it and you were not createdfor any reason; it all just happened as mutter and energy interacted according to the laws of nature (which, once life got started, included the principles of Darwinian evolution). Religion is often seen as an answer to the Holy Question because many religions offer",553
Page 233,"218 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s such clear answers to the sub-question of the purpose of life. Science and religion are often seen as antagonists, and, indeed, they battle over the teaching of evolution in the United States precisely because they offer conflicting answers. The second sub-question is the question of purpose within life: “How ought I to live? What should I do to have a good, happyr fulfilling, and meaningful life?” When people ask the Holy Question, one of the things they are hoping for is a set of principles orgoals that can guide their actions and give their choices meaning or value. (That is why the form of the an­ swer in the Monty Python movie is correct: “Try to be nice to people, avoid eating fat , . . ”). Aristotle asked about arete (excellence/virtue) and telos (purpose/goal), and he used the metaphor that people are like archers, who need a clear target at which to aim .13Without a target or goal, one is left with the animal default: Just let the elephant graze or roam where he pleases. And because elephants live in herds, one ends up doing what everyone else is doing. Yet the human mind has a rider, and as the rider be­ gins to think more abstractly in adolescence, there may come a time when he looks around, past the edges of the herd, and asks: Where are we all go­ ing?And why? This is what happened to me my senior year of high school. In my adolescent existentialism, I conflated the two sub-questions. Be­ cause I embraced the scientific answer to the question of the purpose of life, I thought it precluded finding purpose within life. It was an easy mis­ take to make because many religions teach that the two questions are in­ separable. If you believe that God created you as part of His plan, then you can figure out how you ought to live if you are going to play your part prop­ erly. The Purpose Driven Life14 is a forty-day course that teaches readers how to find purpose within life from the theological answer to the question of the purpose oflife. The two questions can, however, be separated. The first asks about life from the outside; it looks at people, the Earth, and the stars as objects— “Why do they all exist?”—and is properly addressed by theologians, physi­ cists, and biologists. The second question is about life from the inside, as a subject—“How can I find a sense of meaning and purpose?”—and is prop­ erly addressed by theologians, philosophers, and psychologists. The second question is really empirical—a question of fact that can be examined by",587
Page 234,"Happiness Comesfrom Between 21 9 scientific means. Why do some people live lives full of zest, commitment, find meaning, but others feel that their lives are empty and pointless? Far Ilie rest of this chapter I will ignore the purpose of life and search for the fiictors that give rise to a sense of purpose within life. L o v e a n d W o r k When a computer breaks, it doesn’t fix itself. You have to open it up and do something to it, or bring it to a specialist for repair. The computer metaphor h;is so pervaded our thought that we sometimes think about people as com­ puters, and about psychotherapy as the.repair shop or a kind of reprogram­ ming. But people are not computers, and they usually recover on their owti from almost anything that happens to them . 1I think a better metaphor is fhill people are like plants. During graduate school, I had a small garden ix\ front of my house in Philadelphia. I was not a very good gardener, and I Iraveled a lot in the summers, so sometimes my plants withered and nearly tiled. But the amazing thing I learned about plants is that as long as they are not completely dead, theywill spring back to full and glorious life if you just gel the conditions right. You can’t fix a plant; you can only give it the right conditions—water, sun, and soil—and then wait. It will do the rest. If people are like plants, what are the conditions we need to flourish? In the happiness formula from chapter 5, H(appiness) = S(etpoint) + Condi­ tions) +V(oluntary activities), what exactly is C? The biggest part of C, as I siiid in chapter6, is love. No man, woman, or child is an island. We are tillrasocial creatures, and we cant be happy without having friends and se~ cure attachments to other people. The second most important part of C is having and pursuing the right goals, in order to create states of flow and engagement. In the modern world, people can find goals and flow in many settings, but most people find most of their flow at work . 1(I define work hmadly to include anyone’s answer to the question “So, what do you do?’ ""Student”and “full-time parent”are both good answers). Love and work are, Im people, obvious analogues to water and sunshine for plants . 1When I i icl was asked what a normal person should be able to do well, he is re>- puled to have said, “Love and work .”1If therapy can help a person do thos^",570
Page 235,"2 2 0 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s two things well, it has succeeded. In Maslow’s famous hierarchy of needs, once people have satisfied their physical needs (such as food and safety), they move on to needs for love and then esteem, which is earned mostly through ones work. Even before Freud, Leo Tolstoy wrote: “One can live magnificently in this world, if one knows how to work and how to love, to work for the person one loves and to love one swork .”19Having earlier said everything I want to say about love, I will say no more here. But I must say much more about work. When Harry Harlow took his students to the zoo, they were surprised to find that apes and monkeys would solve problems just for the fun of it. Be­ haviorism had no way to explain such unreinforced behavior. In 1959, the Harvard psychologist Robert White 20 concluded, after surveying research in behaviorism and psychoanalysis, that both theories had missed what Harlow had noticed: the overwhelming evidence that people and many other mammals have a basic drive to make things happen. You can see it in the joy infants take with “busy boxes,” the activity centers that allow them to convert flailing arm movements into ringing bells and spinning wheels. You can see it in the toys to which older children gravitate. The ones I most intensely longed for as a boy were those that caused movement or action at a distance: remote-controlled cars, guns that shot plastic pellets, and rock­ ets or airplanes of any kind. And you can see it in the lethargy that often overtakes people who stop working, whether from retirement, being fired, or winning a lottery. Psychologists have referred to this basic need as a need for competence, industry, or mastery. White called it the “effectance motive,” which he defined as the need or drive to develop competence through interacting with and controlling ones environment. Effectance is almost as basic a need as food and water, yet it is not a deficit need, like hunger, that is satisfied and then disappears for a few hours. Rather, White said, effectance is a constant presence in our lives: Dealing with the environment means carrying on a continuing transac­ tion which gradually changes ones relation to the environment. Because there is no consummatory climax, satisfaction has to be seen as lying in a considerable series of transactions, in a trend of behavior rather than a goal that is achieve.21",533
Page 236,"Happiness Comesfrom Between 221 Theeffectance motive helps explain the progress principle: We get more pleasure from making progress toward our goals than we do from achieving them because, as Shakespeare said, “Joys soul lies in the doing .”22 Now we can look at the conditions of modern work. Karl Marxs criticism of capitalism23 was based in part on his justified claim that the Industrial Revolution had destroyed the historical relationship between craftsmen and the goods they produced. Assembly-line work turned people into cogs in a #iant machine, and the machine didn’t care about workers’ need for ef- fcctance. Later research on job satisfaction supported Marx’s critique, but lidded nuance. In 1964, the sociologists Melvin Kohn and Carmi Schooler 24 surveyed 3,100 American men about their jobs and found that the key to understanding which jobs were satisfying was what they called “occupa­ tional self direction.” Men who were closely supervised in jobs of low com­ plexity and much routine showed the highest degree of alienation (feeling powerless, dissatisfied, and separated from the work). Men who had more latitude in deciding how they approached work that was varied and chal­ lenging tended to enjoy their work much more. When workers had occupa- tional self-direction, their work was often satisfying. More recent research finds that most people approach their work in one of three ways: as ajob, a career, or a calli.25If you see your work as a job, yon do it only for the money, you look at the clock frequently while dream­ ing about the weekend ahead, and you probably pursue hobbies, which sat­ isfy your effectance needs more thoroughly than does your work. If you see your work as a career, you have larger goals of advancement, promotion, and prestige. The pursuit of these goals often energizes you, and you sometimes take workhome with you because you want to get thejob done properly. Yet, fit times, you wonder whyyou work so hard. You might occasionally see your work as a rat race where people are competing for the sake of competing. If you seeyour work as a calling, however, you find your work intrinsically ful­ filling—you are not doing it to achieve something else. You see your work as contributing to the greater good or as playing a rolein some larger enterprise the worth of which seems obvious to you. You have frequent experiences of flow during the work day, and you neither look forward to 'quitting time” nor feel the desire to shout, “Thank God it’s Friday!”You would continue to work, perhaps even without pay, if you suddenly became very wealthy.",562
Page 237,"222 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s You might think that*blue-collar workers have jobs, managers have ca­ reers, and the more respected professionals (doctors, scientists, clergy) have callings. Although there is some truth to that expectation, we can nonethe­ less paraphrase Marcus Aurelius and say, “Work itself is but what you deem it.”Amy Wrzesniewski, a psychologist at NewYork University, finds all three orientations represented in almost every occupation she has examined .26In a study of hospital workers, for example, she found that the janitors who cleaned bed pans and mopped up vomit—perhaps the lowest-rankingjob in a hospital— sometimes saw themselves as part of a team whose goal was to heal people. They went beyond the minimum requirements of theirjob de­ scription, for example, by trying to brighten up the rooms of very sick pa­ tients or anticipating the needs of the doctors and nurses rather than waiting for orders. In so doing, they increased their own occupational self- direction and created for themselves jobs that satisfied their effectance needs. Those janitors who worked this way saw their work as a calling and enjoyed it far more than those who saw it as ajob. The optimistic conclusion coming out of research in positive psychology is that most people can get more satisfaction from their work. The first step is to know your strengths. Take the strengths test 27 and then choose work that allows you to use your strengths every day, thereby giving your­ selfat least scattered moments of flow. I£you are stuck in ajob that doesn't match your strengths, recast and reframe your job so that it does. Maybe you’ll have to do some extra work for a while, like the hospital janitors who were acting on strengths of kindness, loving, emotional intelligence, or cit­ izenship. If you can engage your strengths, you’ll find more gratification in work; if you find gratification, you’ll shift into a more positive, approach- oriented mindset; and in such a mindset it will be easier for you to see the bigger picture28—the contribution you are making to a larger enterprise— within which yourjob might turn into a calling. Work at its best, then, is about connection, engagement, and commit­ ment. As the poet Kahlil Gibran said, “Work is love made visible.”Echoing Tolstoy, he gave examples of work done with love: It is toweave the cloth with threads drawnfrom your heart, even as ifyour beloved were to wear that cloth.",545
Page 238,"Happiness Comesfrom Between 223 It is to build a house with affection, even as ifyour belovedwere to dwell in that house. It is to sowseedswith tenderness and reap the harvest with joy, even as ifyour belovedwere to eat thefruit.29 Love and work are crucial for human happiness because, when done well, they draw us out of ourselves and into connection with people and projects beyond ourselves. Happiness comes from getting these connec- lions right. Happiness comes not just from within, as Buddha and Epicte- I mssupposed, or even from a combination of internal and external factors (as I suggested as a temporaryfix at the end of chapter 5). The correct ver­ sion of the happiness hypothesis, as IT1illustrate below, is that happiness i nines from between. V i t a lE n g a g e m e n t Plants thrive under particular conditions, and biologists can now tell us how sunlight and water get converted into plant growth. People thrive un­ der particular conditions, and psychologists can now tell us how love and work get converted into happiness and a sense of meaning. The man who found flow, Mihalyi Csikszentmihalyi, thinks big. Not con­ tent to study moments of flow (by beeping people several times a day), he wanted to know what role flow plays in life as a whole, particularly in the lives of creative people. So he turned to the experts: paragons of success in Ihe arts and sciences. He and his students have interviewed hundreds of Miiecessful painters, dancers, poets, novelists, physicists, biologists, andpsy- i hologists—all people who seem to have crafted lives for themselves built iiioimd a consuming passion. These are admirable lives, desirable lives, the *orl that many young people dream of having when they look to these people as role models. Csikszentmihalyi wanted to know how such lives happened. How does a person come to make such a commitment to a field and then become so extraordinarily creative? 11 is interviews'showed that everypath is unique, yet most of them led in the same direction: from initial interest and enjoyment, with moments of",468
Page 239,"224 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s flow, through a relationship to people, practices, and values that deepened over many years, thereby enabling even longer periods of flow. Csikszent­ mihalyi and his students, particularly Jeanne Nakamura, have studied the end state of this deepening process and called it “vital engagement,”which they define as “a relationship to the world that is characterized both by ex­ periences of flow (enjoyed absorption) and by meaning (subjective signifi­ cance ).”30Vital engagement is another way of saying that work has become “love made visible”; Nakamura and Csikszentmihalyi even describe vital engagement in words that could almost have been taken from a romance novel: “There is a strong felt connection between self and object; a writer is ‘swept away by a project, a scientist is mesmerized by the stars/ The re­ lationship has subjective meaning; work is a calling / ”31 Vital engagement is a subtle concept, and the first time I taught a course on positive psychology, the students weren’t getting it, I thought that an ex­ ample would help, so I called on a woman who had been quiet in class, but who had once mentioned her interest in horses. I asked Katherine to tell us how she got involved in ridiftg. She described her childhood love of ani­ mals, and her interest in horses in particular. At the age of ten she begged her parents to let her take riding lessons, and they agreed. She rode for fun at first,-but soon began riding in competitions. When it came time to choose a college, she chose the University ofVirginia in part because it had an excellent riding team. Katherine was shy, and, after narrating these basic facts, she stopped talking. She had told us about her increasing commitment to riding, but vi- tal engagement is more than just commitment. I probed further. I asked whether she could tell us the names of specific horses from previous cen­ turies. She smiled and said, almost as if admitting a secret, that she had begun to read about horses when she began to ride, and that she knew u great deal about the history of horses and about famous horses in history. I asked whether she had made friends through riding, and she told us thal most of her close friends were “horse friends,”people she knew from horse shows and from riding together. As she talked, she grew more animated and confident. It was as clear from her demeanor as from her words that Katherine had found vital engagement in riding. Just as Nakamura and Csikszentmihalyi had said, her initial interest grew into an ever-deepening",578
Page 240,"Happiness Comesfrom Between 225 lelationship, an ever-thickening web connecting her to an activity, a tradi­ tion, and a community. Riding for Katherine had become a source of flow, joy, identity, effectance, and relatedness. It was part of her answer to the question of purpose within life. Vital engagement does not reside in the person or in the environment; it rxists in the relationship between the two. The web ofmeaning that engulfed Katherine grewand thickened gradually and organically, over many years. Vi­ tal engagement is what I was missing during my senior year of high school. I liad love, and I had work (in the form of reasonably challenging high school (lasses), but my workwas not part ofa larger project beyond gettinginto col­ lege. In fact, it was precisely when the college project was ending—when I had sent off my college applications and was in limbo, not knowing where I would go next—that I became paralyzed by the Holy Question. CJetting the right relationship between you and your work is not entirely ii|>to you. Some occupations come ready-made forvital engagement; others make it difficult. As market forces were reshaping many professions in the United States during the 1990s—medicine, journalism, science, educa­ tion, and the arts—people in those fields began to complain that the qual­ ity of work and the quality of life were sometimes compromised by the irlrntless drive to increase profits. Csikszentmihalyi teamed up with two olher leading psychologists—Howard Gardner at Harvard, and William Da­ mon at Stanford— to study these changes, and to see why some professions uremed healthy while others were growing sick. Picking the fields of genet­ ics and journalism as case studies, they conducted dozens of interviews with people in each field. Their conclusion 32 is as profound as it is simple: It's a matter of alignment. When doing good (doing high-quality work that pioduces something of use to others) matches up with doing well (achiev­ ing wealth and professional advancement), a field is healthy. Genetics, for example, is a healthy field because all parties involved respect and reward the very best science. Even though pharmaceutical companies and market Iorres were beginning to inject vast amounts of money into university re­ pealeh labs in the 1990s, the scientists whom Csikszentmihalyi, Gardner, mid Damon interviewed did not believe they were being asked to lower IIicir standards, cheat, lie, or sell their souls. Geneticists believed that their IirkI was in a golden age in which excellent work brought great benefits to",567
Page 241,"226 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s the general public, the pharmaceutical companies, the universities, and the scientists themselves. Journalists, on the other hand, were in trouble. Most of them had gone into journalism with high ideals—respect for the truth, a desire to make a difference in the world, and a firm belief that a free press is a crucial sup­ port of democracy. But by the 1990s, the decline of family-run newspapers and the rise of corporate media empires had converted American journal­ ism into just another profit center where the only thing that mattered was will it sell, and will it outsell our competitors? Good journalism was some­ times bad for business. Scare stories, exaggeration, trumped up conflict, and sexual scandal, all cut up into tiny digestible pieces, were often more profitable. Many journalists who worked for these empires confessed to having a sense of being forced to sell out and violate their own moral stan­ dards. Their world was unaligned, and they could not become vitally en­ gaged in the larger but ignoble mission of gaining market share at any cost. * C r o s s- Le v e l C o h e r e n c e The word “coherence” literally means holding or sticking together, but it is usually used to refer to a system, an idea, or a worldview whose parts fit together in a consistent and efficient way. Coherent things work well: A coherent worldview can explain almost anything, while an incoherent worldview is hobbled by internal contradictions. A coherent profession> such as genetics, can get on with the business of genetics, while an inco­ herent profession, like journalism, spends a lot of time on self-analysis and self-criticism.33Most people know theres a problem, but they can’t agree on what to do about it. Whenever a system can be analyzed at multiple levels, a special kind of coherence occurs when the levels mesh and mutually interlock. We saw this cross-level coherence in the analysis of personality: If your lower-level traits match up with your coping mechanisms, which in turn are consistent with your life story, your personality is well integrated and you can get on with the business of living. When these levels do not cohere, you are likely",487
Page 242,"Happiness Comesfrom Between 227 lo be torn by internal contradictions and neurotic conflicts .34You might need adversity to knock yourself into alignment. And if you do achieve co­ herence, the moment when things come together may be one of the most profound of your life. Like the moviegoer who later finds out what she missed in the first half hour, your life will suddenly make more sense. I'inding coherence across levels feels like enlightenment ,35and it is crucial for answering the question of purpose within life. People are multilevel systems in another way: We are physical objects (bodies and brains) from which minds somehow emerge; and from our minds, somehowsocieties and cultures form .36Tounderstand ourselves fully wc must study all three levels—physical, psychological, and sociocultural. There has long been a division of academic labor: Biologists studied the brain as a physical object, psychologists studied the mind, and sociologists and anthropologists studied the socially constructed environments within which minds develop and function. But a division of labor is productive only when the tasks are coherent—when all lines of work eventually com­ bine to make something greater than the sum of its parts. For much of the twentieth century that didnt happen—each field ignored the others and fo­ cused on its own questions. But nowadays cross-disciplinary work is flour­ ishing, spreading out from the middle level (psychology) along bridges (or perhaps ladders) down to the physical level (for example, the field of cogni- Iive neuroscience) and up to the sociocultural level (for example, cultural psychology). The sciences are linking up, generating cross-level coherence, anil, like magic, big new ideas are beginning to emerge. Here is one of the most profound ideas to come from the ongoing synthe­ sis: Peoplegain a senseofmeaning when their livescohereacross the three lev­ els of their existence.37The best way I can illustrate this idea is to take you hack to Bhubaneswar, India. I have already explained the logic of purity and pollution, so you understand why Hindus bathe before making an offering lo Clod, and why they are careful about what they touch on the way to the lemple. You understand why contact with a dog, a menstruating woman, or a person of low caste can render a person of high caste temporarily impure niid unfit to make an offering. But you understand all this only at the psy­ chological level and, even then, only as a set of propositions grasped by the",535
Page 243,"228 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s rider and stored away as explicit knowledge. You do not feel polluted after touching the arm of a woman you know to be menstruating; you do not even know what it would feel like to feel polluted in that way. Suppose, however, that you grow up as a Brahmin in Bhubaneswar. Every day of your life you have to respect the invisible lines separating pure from profane spaces, and you have to keep track of peoples fluctuating levels of purity before you can touch them or take anything from their hands. You bathe several times a day—short baths or brief immersions in sacred water— always before making a religious offering. And your offerings are not just words: Youactuallygive some food to God (the priest touches your offeringto the image, icon, or object in the inner sanctum), which is returned to you so thatyou may eat what God left over. Eating someone’sleftovers shows awill­ ingness to take in that persons saliva, which demonstrates both intimacy and subordination in Bhubaneswar. Eating Gods leftovers is an act of intimacy and subordination, too. After twenty years of these practices, your under­ standing of Hindu rituals is visceral. Your explicit understanding is supported by a hundred physical feelings: shivering during the morning bath at sunrise; the pleasure of washing off dust and putting on clean clothes after a bath on a hot afternoon; the feeling of bare feet on cool stone floors as you approach the inner sanctum; the smell of incense; the sound of mumbled prayers in Sanskrit, the bland (pure) taste of rice that has been returned to you from God. In all these ways, your understanding at the psychological level has spread down to your physical embodiment, and when the conceptual and visceral levels connect, the ritualsfeel right to you. Your understanding of ritual spreads up to the sociocultural level, too. You areimmersed in a 4,000-year-oldreligious tradition that provided most of the stories you heard as a child, many of which involved plot elements of purity and pollution. Hinduism structures your social space through a caste system based on the purity and pollution of various occupations, and it structures your physical space with the topography of purity and pollution that keeps temples, kitchens, and right hands pure. Hinduism also gives you a cosmol­ ogy in which souls reincarnate by moving up or down on the vertical dimen­ sion of divinity. So every time you make an offering to God, the three levels ofyour existence are all aligned and mutually interlocking. Your physical feel-",551
Page 244,"Happiness Comesfrom Between 229 Ings and conscious thoughts cohere with your actions, and all of it makes perfect sense within the larger culture of which you are a part. As you make an offering to God, you dont think, “What does this all mean? Why am I do­ ing Ihis?”The experience of meaningfulness just happens. It emerges auto­ matically from cross-level coherence. Once again, happiness—or a sense of meaningfulness that imparts richness to experience—comes from between. In contrast, think about the last empty ritual you tookpart in. Maybe you were asked to join hands and chant with a group of strangers while attend­ ing a wedding ceremony for a friend who is of a different religion. Perhaps yon took part in a new age ceremony that borrowed elements from Native Americans, ancient Celts, and Tibetan Buddhists. You probably understood Ilie symbolism of the ritual—understood it consciously and explicitly in the uay that the rider is so good at doing. Yet you felt self-conscious, maybe even silly, while doing it. Something was missing. You cant just invent a good ritual through reasoning about symbolism. You need a tradition within which the symbols are embedded, and you need lo invoke bodily feelings that have some appropriate associations. Then you need a community to endorse and practice it over time. To the extent that a <ommunity has many rituals that cohere across the three levels, people in Ilie community are likely to feel themselves connected to the community and its traditions. If the community also offers guidance on how to live and what is of value, then people are unlikely to wonder about the question of piapose within life. Meaning and purpose simply emerge from the coher­ ence, and people can get on with the business of living. But conflict, paraly­ sis, and anomie are likely when a community fails to provide coherence, or, woise, when its practices contradict peoples gut feelings or their shared mythology and ideology. (Martin Luther King, Jr., forced Americans to con- limii contradictions between practices of racial segregation and ideals about equalityand freedom. Many people didn’t like that.) People dont necessarily need to find meaning in their national identity—indeed, in large and diverse nations such as the United States, Russia, and India, religion might hold yifiller promise for cross-level coherence and purpose within life. Religions »Insuch a good job of creating coherence, in fact, that some scholars 38 be­ lievethey were designed for that purpose.",521
Page 245,"2 3 0 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s G o d G i v e sU s H i v e s When I first began to study morality as a philosophy major in college, my fa­ ther said, “Why aren’t you studying religion, too? How could people have morality without God?”As a young atheist with a strong sense of morality (well over the border into self-righteousness), I was insulted by my fathers suggestion. Morality, I thought, was about relationships among people; it was about a commitment to doing the right thing, even when it goes against your self-interest. Religion, I thought, was a bunch of rules that made no sense and stories that could never have happened, written down by people and then falsely attributed to a supernatural entity. I now believe my father was right—morality has its origins in religion— but not for the reasons he believed. Morality and religion both occur in some form in all human cultures 39and are almost always both intertwined with the values, identity, and daily life of the culture. Anyone who wants a full, cross-level account of human nature, and of how human beings find purpose and meaning in their lives, must make that account cohere with what is known about morality and religion. From an evolutionary perspective, morality is a problem. If evolution is all about survival of the fittest, then why do people help each other so much? Why do they give to charity, risk their lives to save strangers, and volunteer to fight in wars? Darwin thought the answer was easy: Altruism evolves for the good of the group: There can be no doubt that a tribe including many members who, from possessing in a high degree the spirit of patriotism, fidelity, obedience, courage, and sympathy, were always ready to aid one another, and to sac­ rifice themselves for the common good would be victorious over most other tribes, and this would be natural selecti.40 Darwin proposed that groups compete, just like individuals, and there­ fore psychological features that make groups successful— such as patriot­ ism, courage, and altruism toward fellow group members— should spread like any other trait. But once evolutionary theorists began testing predic-",470
Page 246,"Happiness Comesfrom Between 231 lions rigorously, using computers to model the interactions of individuals who use various strategies (such as pure selfishness versus tit for tat), they quickly came to appreciate the seriousness of the “free-rider problem.” In groups in which people make sacrifices for the common good, an individual who makes no such sacrifices—who in effect takes a free ride on the backs of the altruists—comes out ahead. In the cold logic of these computer sim­ ulations, whoever accumulates the most resources in one generation goes on to produce more children in the next, so selfishness is adaptive but altru­ ism is not. The only solution to the free-rider problem is to make altruism pay, and two back-to-back breakthroughs in evolutionary thinking showed how to do that. In chapter 3 I presented kin altruism (be nice to those who share your genes) and reciprocal altruism (be nice to those who might recip­ rocate in the future) as two steps on the way to ultrasociality. Once these two solutions to the free-rider problem were published (in 1966 and 1971, respectively),41most evolutionary theorists considered the problem of altru­ ism solved and essentially declared group selection illegal. Altruism could he explained away as a special kind of selfishness, and anyone who followed Darwin in thinking that evolution worked for the “good of the group” in­ stead of the good of the individual (or better yet, the good of the gene ) ,42 was dismissed as a mushy-headed romantic. The ban on group selection had one loophole. For creatures that really do compete, live, and die as a group, such as the other ultrasocial animals (bees, wasps, ants, termites, and naked mole rats), group selection explana- Iions were appropriate. There is a real sense in which a beehive or an ant colony is a single organism, each insect a cell in the larger bod.43Like stem cells, ants can take different physical forms to perform specific functions needed by the colony: small bodies to care for larva, larger bodies with spe­ cial appendages to forage for food or fight off attackers. Like cells in the im­ mune system, ants will sacrifice themselves to protect the colony: In one species of Malaysian ant ,44members of the soldier caste store a sticky sub­ stance just under their exoskeletons. In the midst of battle, they explode Iheir bodies, turning themselves into suicide bombers to gum up their ad­ versaries. For ants and bees, the queen is not the brain; she is the ovary, and Ihe entire hive or colony can be seen as a body shaped by natural selection",568
Page 247,"232 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s to protect the ovary and help it create more hives or colonies. Because all members really arein the same boat, group selection is not just permissible as an explanation; it is mandatory Might this loophole apply to humans as well? Do humans compete, live, and die as a group? Tribes and ethnic groups do grow and spread or fade and die out, and sometimes this process has occurred by genocide. Furthermore, human societies often have an extraordinary division of labor, sothe compar­ ison to bees and ants is tempting. But as long as each human being has the opportunity to reproduce, the evolutionary payoffs for investing in ones own welfare and ones own offspring will almost always exceed the payoffs for contributing to the group; in the long run, selfish traits will therefore spread at the expense of altruistic traits. Even during war and genocide, when group interests are most compelling, it is the coward who runs and hides, rather thanjoining his comrades on the front lines, who is most likely to pass on his genes to the next generation. Evolutionary theorists have therefore stood united, since the early 1970s, in their belief that group selection simply did not play a role in shaping human nature. But wait a second. This is not an all-or-nothingissue. Even if the compe­ tition of individuals within a group is the most important process in human evolution, group selection (competition between groups) could have played a role too. The evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson 45 has recently ar­ gued that the banishment of group selection theories on the basis of some oversimplified computer models from the 1960s was one of the biggest mistakes in the history of modern biology. If you make the models more re­ alistic, more like real human beings, group selectionjumps right out at you. Wilson points out that human beings evolve at two levels simultaneously: genetic and cultural. The simple models of the 1960s worked well for crea­ tures without culture; for them, behavioral traits must all be encoded in the genes, which are passed on only along lines of kinship. But everything a person does is influenced not onlybyher genesJbut also by her culture, and cultures evolve, too. Because elements of culture show, variation (people invent new things) and selection (other people do or dont adopt those vari­ ations), cultural traits can be analyzed in a Darwinian framework 46 just as well as physical traits (birds’beaks, giraffes' necks). Cultural elements,",543
Page 248,"Happiness Comesfrom Between 233 however, don’t spread by the slow process of having children; they spread rapidly whenever people adopt a new behavior, technology, or belief. Cul­ tural traits can even spread from tribe to tribe or nation to nation, as when the plough, the printing press, or reality television programs became popu­ lar in many places in quick succession. Cultural and genetic evolution are intertwined. The human capacity for culture—a strong tendency to learn from each other, to teach each other, and to build upon what we have learned—is itself a genetic innovation that happened in stages over the last few million years .47 But once our brains reached a critical threshold, perhaps 80,000 to 10 0 ,0 years ago ,48cultural innovation began to accelerate; a strong evolutionary pressure then shaped brains to take further advantage of culture. Individuals who could best learn from others were more successful than their less “cultured”brethren, and as brains became more cultural, cultures became more elaborate, further in­ creasing the advantage of having a more cultural brain. All human beings to­ day are the products of the co-evolution of a set of genes (which is almost identical across cultures) and a set of cultural elements (which is diverse across cultures, but still constrained by the capacities and predispositions of the human mind ).49For example, the genetic evolution of the emotion of disgust made it possible (but not inevitable) for cultures to develop caste systems based on occupation and supported by disgust toward those who perform “polluting” activities. A caste system then restricts marriage to within-caste pairings, which in turn alters the course of genetic evolution. After a thousand years of inbreeding within caste, castes will diverge slightly on a few genetic traits—for example, shades of skin color—which might in turn lead to a growing cultural association of castewith color rather than just with occupation. (It only takes twenty generations of selective breeding to create large differences of appearance and behavior in other mammals .)50In this way, genes and cultures co-evolve;51they mutually affect each other, and neither process can be studied in isolation for human beings. Wilson examines religion from this co-evolutionary perspective. The word religion literally means, in Latin, to link or bind together; and despite the vast variation in the worlds religions, Wilson shows that religions al­ ways serve to coordinate and orient peoples behavior toward each other",501
Page 249,"2 3 4 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s and toward the group as a whole, sometimes for the purpose of competing with other groups. The sociologist Emile Durkheim first developed this view of religion in 1912: A religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say, things set apart and forbidden—beliefs and prac­ tices which unite into one single moral community called a church, all those who adhere to them .52 Wilson shows how religious practices help members solve coordination problems. For example, trust and therefore trade are greatly enhanced when all parties are part of the same religious community, and when reli­ gious beliefs $ay that God knows and cares about the honesty of the par­ ties. (The anthropologist Pascal Boyer 53points out that gods and ancestor spirits are often thought to be omniscient, yet what they most care about in this vast universe is the moral intentions hidden in the hearts of the living.) Respect for rules is enhanced when rules have an element of sacredness, and when they are backed up by supernatural sanction and the gossip or ostracism of ones peers. Wilsons claim is that religious ideas, and brains that responded to those ideas, corevolved. Even if the belief in supernatu­ ral entities emerged originally for some other reason, or as an accidental byproduct in the evolution of cognition (as some scholars have claimed ) ,54 groups that parlayed those beliefs into social coordination devices (for ex­ ample, by linking them to emotions such as shame, fear, guilt, and love) found a cultural solution to the free-rider problem and then reaped the enormous benefits of trust and cooperation. If stronger belief led to greater individual benefits, or if a group developed a way to punish or exclude those who did not share in its beliefs and practices, conditions were per­ fect for the co-evolution of religion and religious brains. (Consistent with Wilsons proposal, the geneticist Dean Hamer recently reported evidence from twin studies that suggests a particular gene may be associated with a stronger tendency to have religious and self-transcendent experiences .)55 Religion, therefore, could have pulled human beings into the group- selection loophole. By making people long ago feel and act as though they",486
Page 250,"Happiness Comesfrom Between 235 were part of one body, religion reduced the influence of individual selec- lion (which shapes individuals to be selfish) and brought into play the force of group selection (which shapes individuals to work for the good of Iheir group). But we didn’t make it all the way through the loophole: Hu­ man nature is a complex mix of preparations for extreme selfishness and extreme altruism. Which side of our nature we express depends on culture mid context. When opponents of evolution object that human beings are not mere apes, they are correct. We are also part bee. ' H a r m o n y a n d P u r p o s e Reading Wilsons Darwins Cathedral is like taking ajourney to Spaceland. You can look down on the vast tapestry of human cultures and see why things are woven in the way that they are. Wilson says his own private hell would be to be locked forever into a room full of people discussing the hypocrisies of religion, for example, that many religions preach love, com­ passion, and virtue yet sometimes cause war, hatred, and terrorism. From Wilsons higher perspective, there is no contradiction. Group selection erentes interlocking genetic and cultural adaptations that enhance peace, harmony and cooperation within the group for the express purpose of in­ creasing the groups ability to compete with other groups. Group selection does not end conflict; itjust pushes it up to the next level of social organi­ zation. Atrocities committed in the name of religion are almost always committed against out-group members, or against the most dangerous people of all: apostates (who try to leave the group) and traitors (who un­ dermine the group). A second puzzle that Wilson can solve is why mysticism, everywhere and always, is about transcending the self and merging with something larger than the self. When William James analyzed mysticism, he focused on the psychological state of “cosmic consciousness ”56 and on the techniques de­ veloped in all the major religions to attain it. Hindus and Buddhists use meditation and yoga to attain the state of samadhi, in which “the subject- nhjcct distinction and ones sense of an individual self disappear in a state",467
Page 251,"236 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s usually described as one of supreme peace, bliss, and illumination .”57James found much the same goal in Christian and Muslim mysticism, often at­ tained through repetitive prayer. He quoted the eleventh-century Muslim philosopherA1Ghazzali, who spent several years worshipping with the Sufis of Syria. A1 Ghazzali attained experiences of “transport” and revelation that he said cannot be described in words, although he did try to explain to his Muslim readers the essence of Sufism: The first condition for a Sufi is to purge his heart entirely of all that is not God. The next key of the contemplative life consists in the humble prayers which escape from the fervent soul, and in the meditations on God in which the heart is swallowed up entirely. But in reality this is only the beginning of the Sufi life, the end of Sufism being total absorption in God .58 From Wilsons perspective, mystical experience is an “off”button for the self. When the self is turned off, people become just a. cell in the larger body, a bee in the larger hive. It is no wonder that the after effects of mys­ tical experience are predictable; people usually feel a stronger commitment to God or to helping others, often by bringing them to God. The neuroscientist Andrew Newberg 59 has studied the brains of people undergoing mystical experiences, mostly during meditation, and has found where that off-switch might be. In the rear portion of the brains parietal lobes (under the rear portion of the top of the skull) are two patches of cor­ tex Newberg calls the “orientation association areas.”The patch in the left hemisphere appears to contribute to the mental sensation of having a lim­ ited and physically defined body, and thus keeps track of your edges. The corresponding area in the right hemisphere maintains a map of the space around you. These two areas receive input from your senses to help them maintain an ongoing representation of your self and its location in space. At the verymoment when people report achieving states of mystical union, these two areas appear to be cut off. Input from other parts of the brain is reduced, and overall activity in these orientation areas is reduced, too. But Newberg believes they are still trying to do their jobs: The area on the left",503
Page 252,"Happiness Comesfrom Between 237 tries to establish the body’s boundaries and doesn’t find them; the area on the right tries to establish the self’s location in space and doesn’t find it. The person experiences a loss of self combined with a paradoxical expan­ sion of the self out into space, yet with no fixed location in the normal world of three dimensions. The person feels merged with something vast something larger than the self. Newberg believes that rituals that involve repetitive movement and chanting, particularly when they are performed by many people at the sarne lime, help to set up ‘resonance patterns” in the brains of the participants that make this mystical state more likely to happen. The-historian William McNeill, drawing on very different data, came to the same conclusion. When McNeill was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1941, basic training re­ quired that he march for hundreds of hours on the drill field in close forma­ tion with a few dozen other men. At first, McNeill thought the marching was just a way^to pass the time because his base had no weapons with which to train. But after a few weeks of training, the marching began to in­ duce in him an altered state of consciousness: Words are inadequate to describe the emotion aroused by the prolonged movement in unison that drilling involved. A sense of pervasive well­ being is what I recall; more specifically, a strange sense of personal enlargement; assort of swelling out, becoming bigger than life, thanks to participation in collective ri.60l Decades later, McNeill studied the role that synchronized movement— dunce, religious ritual, and military training—has played in history. In Keep, lug Together in Time,61 he concludes that human societies since the begin­ ning of recorded history have used synchronized movement to create harmony and cohesion within groups, sometimes in the service of preparing lor hostilities with other groups. McNeills conclusion suggests that synchro­ nized movement and chanting might be evolved mechanisms for activating Ihe altruistic motivations created in the process of group selection. The ex­ itemc self-sacrifice characteristic of group-selected species such as ants and bees can often be found among soldiers. McNeill quotes an extraordinary",463
Page 253,"2 3 8 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s passage from the book The Warriors: Reflections of Men in Battle that de­ scribes the thrilling communal state that soldiers sometimes enter: “I”passes insensibly into a “we,”“my”becomes “our,”and individual fate loses its central importance. ... I believe that it is nothing less than the assurance of immortality that makes self-sacrifice at these moments so relativelyeasy. ... I mayfall, but I do not die, for that which is real in me goesforward and lives on in the comrades for whom I gave up my life .62 There is indeed something larger than the self, able to provide people with a sense of purpose they think worth dying for: the group. (Of course, one groups noble purpose is sometimes another groups pure evil.) T h e M e a n i n g o f L i f e What can you do to have a good, happy, fulfilling, arid meaningful life? What is the answer to the question of purpose within life? I believe the an­ swer can be found only by understanding the kind of creature that we are, divided in the many ways we are divided. We were shaped by individual se­ lection to be selfish creatures who struggle for resources, pleasure, and prestige, and we were shaped by group selection to be hive creatures who long to lose ourselves in something larger. We are social creatures who need love and attachments, and we are industrious creatures with needs for ef­ fectance, able to enter a state ofvital engagement with our work. We are the rider and we are the elephant, and our mental health depends on the two working together, each drawing on the others’ strengths. I dont believe there is an inspiring answer to the question, “What is the purpose of life?” Yet by drawing on ancient wisdom and modern science, we can find com­ pelling answers to the question of purpose within life. The final version of the happiness hypothesis is that happiness comes from between. Happiness is not something that you can find, acquire, or achieve directly. You have to get the conditions right and then wait. Some of those conditions are within you, such as coherence among the parts and levels of your personality.",479
Page 254,"Happiness Comesfrom Between 239 Other conditions require relationships to things beyond you: Just as plants need sun, water, and good soil to thrive, people need love, work, and a con­ nection to something larger. It is worth striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, between yourself and your work, and between yourself and something larger than yourself. If you get these relationships right, a sense of purpose and meaning will emerge.",95

Religion and science, for example, are often thought to be opponents, but as I have shown, the insights of ancient religions and of modem science are both needed to reach afull understanding ofhuman nature and the condi- tions ofhuman satisfaction. The ancients may have known little about biology, chemistry, and physics, but many were goodpsychologists. Psychologyand re­ ligion can benefit bytakingeach other seriously, orat least byagreeing to learn from each other while overlooking the areas ofirreconcilable difference. 241",272
Page 257,"242 T h e H a p p i n e H y p o t h e s i s The Eastern and Western approaches to life are also said to be opposed: The East stresses acceptance and collectivism; the West encourages striv­ ing and individualism. But as weve seen, both perspectives are valuable. Happiness requires changing yourself and changing your world. It requires pursuing your own goals and fitting in with others. Different people at dif­ ferent times in their lives will benefit from drawing more heavily on one approach or the other. And, finally, liberals and conservatives are opponents in the most literal sense, each using the myth of pure evil to demonize the other side and unite their own. But the most important lesson I have learned in my twenty years of research on morality is that nearly all people are morally motivated. Selfishness is a powerful force, particularly in the decisions of individuals, but whenever groups of people come together to make a sustained effort to change the world, you can bet that they arepursuing a vision of virtue, jus­ tice, or sacredness. Material self-interest does little to explain the passions of partisans on issues such as abortion, the environment, or the role of reli­ gion in public life. (Self-interest certainly cannot explain terrorism, but the selflessness made possible by group selection can.) An important dictum of cultural psychology is that each culture devel­ ops expertise in some aspects of human existence, but no culture can be expert in all aspects. The same goes for the two ends of the political spec­ trum. My research 3 confirms the common perception that liberals are ex­ perts in thinking about issues of victimization, equality, autonomy, and the rights of individuals, particularly those of minorities and nonconformists. Conservatives, on the other hand, are experts in thinking about loyalty to the group, respect for authority and tradition, and sacredness .4When one side overwhelms the other, the results are likely to be ugly A society with­ out liberals would be harsh and oppressive to many individuals, A society without conservatives would lose many of the social structures and con­ straints that Durkheim showed are so valuable. Anomie would increase along with freedom. A good place to look for wisdom, therefore, is where you least expect to find it: in the minds of your opponents. You already know the ideas common on your own side. If you can take off the blinders of the myth of pure evil, you might see some good ideas for the first time.",525
